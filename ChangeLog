Tue Jun 25 14:57:03 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.17

Tue Jun 25 14:48:55 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/gtkplot.c: fix a very nasty infinite loop with a memory leak
	  on very very large zoom due to a numerical issue.

Fri Jun 14 15:19:19 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/gtkplot3d.c: fix placement of labels.

	* src/graphing.c: make surface plot slightly smaller so that it fits
	  on screen.

Fri Jun 14 12:01:24 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix precision when the starting limit is 0 or much
	  nearrer zero than the ending limit.  On left/right keys rotate 3d
	  plot, and on all arrow keys move about line plots

Fri Jun 14 10:48:41 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/*: finish updating GtkExtra to 3.0.5

Fri Jun 14 10:04:20 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: Properly report errors from saving files

Thu Jun 13 16:42:42 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/*: copied lots of the files from 3.0.5, only gtkplot3d,
	  gtkplotdt and gtkplotsurface remain unupdated

	* gtkextra/gtkplotps.c: updated to the 3.0.5 version part way, the
	  new one is still broken so the new geometry stuff is not there (it
	  is drawn still upside down and then rotated).  Also
	  a fix from James Cloos to change the EPS header to EPSF from PCF,
	  seems to fix PDF conversion.

	* src/graphing.c: allow PDF export by calling ps2pdf properly,
	  also don't show the epsi checkbox unless we are exporting to EPS

Thu Jun 13 00:12:46 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/*.c: start updating to gtkextra 3.0.5.  Only few files
	  converted: gtkplotcanvas.[ch], gtkplotpc.[ch], gtkextra.[ch],
	  gtkplotprint.[ch].  Must slowly work through custom bugfixes and
	  patches.  Note that gtkplotps.[ch] seems broken, so it's even
	  older than the other files.
	  Also added gtkplotcairo.[ch] for cairo output which is lots nicer

Wed Jun 12 19:20:51 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: adaptive step size for line plots, also detect jump
	  discontinuities

Wed Jun 12 14:22:13 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c, gtkextra/gtkplotdata.c: Allow immediate fitting of
	  the dependent axis on function and parametric plots just as for
	  surface plots.  Fix fitting a parametric plot after zoom was
	  changed.

	* help/C/genius/xml: update documentation

Tue Jun 11 17:36:01 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/geniustests.txt: some new tests

Tue Jun 11 17:19:55 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/factoring.gel: Improve Factors so that for larger
	  numbers it uses "Factorize" rather than a slow naive
	  implementation.

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: minor mersenne update

Tue Jun 11 16:12:48 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: add completion to "help on function"

	* help/C/genius.xml: workaround for broken help browser by adding
	  anchors to function descriptions rather than using the varlistentry
	  id (Which should work but does not).  A bug has been reported there
	  quite some time ago, but I don't think it got any attention.

Wed Apr 24 16:52:56 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* update version number

	* update copyright strings.  Remove the "PhD"  ... the novelty wore
	  off

Wed Apr 24 16:45:17 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parseutil.h, src/funclib.c: properly initialize
	  id.uninitialized (ironic huh? :)

	* src/graphing.c: use the proper temp directory

Wed Apr 24 15:54:44 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/Makefile.am: fix compile

	* help/C/genius.xml: fix some english issues

Wed Apr 24 15:36:52 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: more sane precision computations especially when
	  zoomed in.  Also reduce font size in case of too many digits.

Wed Apr 24 13:58:27 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml: include the function list in the main xml

	* help/C/genius.xml: expand help for the root finding functions

	* lib/equation_solving/find_root.gel: fix FindRootBisection and
	  FindRootMullersMethod to actually work.

Mon Mar 04 12:33:47 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml: fix up the about entry to reflect reality a bit
	  better.

Mon Mar 04 12:29:41 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml: remove scale="50" from images apparently that
	  nowadays makes everything 50 pixels large or some other nonsense
	  like that.

Wed Feb 06 22:22:16 2013  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theoory/primes.gel: update the mersenne stuff

Sun Dec 23 13:22:07 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml: fix documentation of less than and greater than
	  (thanks to Marek Cernocky).  Also expand the documentation in
	  several places a little.

Tue Dec 18 20:49:50 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c, src/calc.c: make a minor optimization, and remove an
	  unsafe unnecessary one

Mon Dec 17 15:15:44 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: bit of post release cleanup

	* help/C/genius.xml: do some fixes, add help about comments and
	  the new way that for loops with floats work.

Mon Dec 17 13:52:35 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.16

Mon Dec 17 13:45:21 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: when forloop (sum/prod/for) is with floats then check
	  for overrun, and if within 2^-20 times the step size, then still
	  execute the last body (assume things were because of roundoff
	  error), this makes things like for n=0 to 1 by 0.1 actually work
	  as expected.

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/eval.c, src/funclib.c, src/matop.c: minor
	  optimization in make_float and new macro to check real part for
	  being floating point

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/testfourier.gel: update testsuite

Tue Dec 11 00:10:02 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: exorcise last vestiges of the
	  linpack inclusion fiasco, and update to new automake initialization
	  format, and also create xz archives on dist

Mon Dec 10 20:58:42 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: add ability to fit dependent axis automatically
	  for surface plots.  When z is not specified by x and y limits are
	  specified for surface plot functions, z is figured out

Mon Dec 10 16:20:53 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: when number of digits of labels is too much
	  use the scientific notation.  Avoids ugly huge numbers.
	  Also make the graph slightly bigger (700x500) and in lineplot mode
	  make the margins bigger so that we don't lose any digits on axes
	  when zooming out or in.  Also fixup labels for gradient.  Gradient
	  is now done only for the range of the function not the whole range
	  that makes it more useful.

	* gtkextra/gtkplot.c, gtkextra/gtkplot3d.c, gtkextra/gtkplotsurface.c:
	  minor cleanup and fix crash when labels too big.  Also fix gradient
	  label style settings, and zero out data we just freed.

Fri Dec 07 21:36:50 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c, src/gnome-genius.c: kill our own overwrite dialog
	  since gtk does it already.  Also when no last dir, set current
	  directory in the file chooser, because the current default 
	  behaviour is godawfully annoying.  I can always click on "Recent",
	  but getting to "current working directory" can be quite a chore.

Fri Dec 07 17:21:26 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c, help/C/gel-function-list.xml: add ExportPlot
	  function

Fri Dec 07 00:27:33 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml, help/C/gel-function-list.xml: add
	  doc for new functions.  Also add details in bits of the docs,
	  they really still need lots of love.

Thu Dec 06 12:03:12 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: Add SurfacePlotDrawGrid to draw data directly from
	  grid to avoid having to make up a data matrix

	* src/graphing.c, gtkextra/gtkplotcanvas.c: Fix flicker during
	  surface animations by properly freezing the display and also
	  letting the painting happen at the right time.

Tue Dec 04 23:31:30 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: some cleanup with respect to fitting dependent
	  axis on surfaces.  Also fix fitting dependent axis for surfaces
	  plotted with SurfacePlotData

Tue Dec 04 19:50:40 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c, gtkextra/gtkplotdt.c:  Add SurfacePlotData which
	  plots 3d graphs from data, so that we can plot all sorts of
	  surfaces.  Also LinePlotDrawAxisLabels was not added as parameter
	  by mistake, so add it

Thu Nov 29 23:02:13 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: Add SurfacePlotDrawLegends parameter, also
	  add it to the UI.  Fix LinePlotDrawLabels, and also make sure
	  LinePlotDrawLegends redraws the plot canvas if changed and
	  plot canvas is active.

Tue Nov 27 12:59:21 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: Require MPFR 2.3.0

	* src/funclib.c: add Bessel functions
	  (BesselJ0, BesselJ1, BesselJn, BesselY0, BesselY1, BesselYn)

Tue Nov 27 10:05:50 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* atlapack/ atblas/: remove, this was just a pain and I don't have
	  time to make it work as is.  We'll try to link to lapack if
	  available or maybe even make it a requirement.  The fortran version
	  seems available on most distros so it should not be a problem.

Fri Jul 13 07:15:05 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c: avoid a small delay on history, it seems no longer
	  necessary.  Thanks to Ingo Ruhnke.

Sat Jun 23 13:21:05 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: update where gimps is up to

Thu May 31 11:54:40 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c, help/C/gel-function-list.xml: Add
	  LineplotDrawAxisLabels parameter and corresponding checkbox on the
	  plotting window to allow not drawing axis labels, useful for
	  doing tiny scaled down diagrams.

Sat Apr 28 16:58:20 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, atlapack, atblas: add LAPACK/BLAS, but
	  so far we don't use them.  We'll probably want to cull the parts
	  we don't use otherwise it just takes forever to compile

Sun Apr 22 23:52:34 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: avoid linked lists on expanding just one row,
	  we can do that directly faster.  Improves speed of things
	  that concatenate things like [a,b,c].  For example sorting.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests

Sun Apr 22 17:53:07 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/structs.h, src/eval.c: MatrixRow tree node is also
	  used in expanding matrices, not just entering, so
	  gint16 was just not enough for width.  So can now
	  handle wider matrices in expansion.

Wed Apr 11 16:56:15 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/symbolic.c: fix derivatives of Im and Re to be the z
	  derivatives.

	* src/funclib.c, src/symbolic.c, help/C/gel-function-list.xml:
	  add the sinc function and its derivative.

Mon Apr 09 21:12:40 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/matop.c: forgotten nargs setting led to a crash when
	  adding fake conj.
	
	* src/compil.c, src/matop.c: correctly set uninitialized flag
	  for identifiers.

	* src/eval.[ch]: avoid some uninitialized compilation warnings.

Mon Apr 09 20:44:03 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c, src/structs.h: Store state of "uninitialized"
	  with identifier nodes so that we don't double warn of uninitialized
	  identifiers with something like "x+5"

Thu Mar 29 10:35:45 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c, src/eval.c, src/funclib.c, lib/*/*.gel: fix some
	  spelling and capitalization

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: fix spelling

	* combinatorics/recursive_sequences.gel: Fix LinearRecursiveSequence,
	  and also allow it to take matrix argument

	* src/geniustests.txt: add a few tests

	* help/C/*.xml: Fixes from Luc Pionchon that I totally forgot about
	  for 1.0.15

Wed Mar 28 17:08:55 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: fix possible uninitialized use when reading 
	  the compiled library (though it's code that never gets hit
	  unless the installed library gets corrupted)

	* NEWS: fix typos

Wed Mar 28 15:57:41 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: when running help and things are not documented and not
	  defined, don't output three lines saying so, just the one error will
	  do.

Tue Mar 27 22:56:49 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.15

Thu Mar 22 11:25:49 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: remove some redundant code, load the exp for
	  matrices lazily

Wed Mar 21 15:39:04 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/*.[ch]: mark a bunch of functions as pure.  Probably doesn't
	  help with optimization, but it might.

Tue Mar 20 13:13:48 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/*/figures/*.eps: remove .eps figures, there is no need for
	  them and they take up lots of space

	* help/{fr,de}/figures/*.png: quantize and optimize

Tue Mar 20 11:39:45 2012  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml, help/C/genius.xml: Add Commutative
	  Algebra section and document the Macaulay stuff (at least stub it).
	  Also add a note to the doc on ceil.

	* src/graphing.c: Fix zooming using pointer for functions that take
	  a long time to draw by moving the zooming code into an idle
	  handler.

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: update where GIMPS has gotten in
	  double checking

	* po/POTFILES.in: remove glade-helper.c

Sun Dec 25 10:28:09 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: update where GIMPS has gotten in
	  double checking

Wed Dec 07 01:40:42 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: fix roots of negative numbers when numerator of power
	  is positive.  Also fix exact roots when power is negative.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests for above

Fri Nov 18 00:53:09 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/symbolic.c: accept log instead of ln for natural log when doing
	  derivative when called as a single variable function.

Thu Jul 14 16:34:40 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel: Optimize SortVector (use quicksort
	  for longer vectors)

Tue Jul 12 23:16:59 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c, src/structs.h, src/parse.y, src/lexer.l, src/calc.c,
	  src/matrixw.[ch]: add increment and swapwith operators which
	  are quicker ways to do these common operations.  swapwith does
	  not yet work with ranges, something that should be remedied.

	* src/funclib.c: improve inline docs for rand and randint

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/testscope.gel: add tests

	* lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel: add ShuffleVector, fix some other
	  functions to accept null

	  features and functions

Tue Jun 28 15:53:40 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/compil.c: use basic ascii for encoding simple strings
	  use base64 for encoding strings that have nonallowed characters.

	* src/compil.c: fix some very minor memory leaks

	* configure.in: raise version

Tue Jun 28 14:09:30 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c, ve/ve-miscui.c: update some deprecated things

	* configure.in: require gtk 2.18 (my current benchmark for
	  gtk version allowed: it appears in current Scientific Linux)

Tue Jun 28 13:08:19 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: use pid_t properly

Wed Jun 01 20:33:17 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/dict.c, src/eval.c, src/funclib.c, src/matrix.c, src/matrix.h,
	  src/matrixw.c: order matrix traversals in a more cache friendly way

Tue Mar 29 01:41:20 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml: define missing entities

	* src/calc.h, src/funclib.c, src/matrix.[ch],
	  src/genius-readline-helper.c, ve/ve-config.c, src/graphing.c:
	  Bunch of optimizations.  Use GQueues where useful, drop use of
	  g_ptr_array for matrices which saves a tiny bit of overhead and
	  will allow graceful handling of out of memory problems rather than
	  just crashing.  Optimize Combinations/Permutations quite a bit.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests.

Wed Feb 16 21:12:34 2011  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: try gnome-help if gtk_open_uri don't work (am
	  using xfce and for whatever reason it doesn't).  Also fix the
	  formatting on error/warning dialogs

Tue Nov 23 13:47:15 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* **/*.png: optimize and quantize pngs a bit further

Thu Oct 28 16:09:42 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: Don't run ps2epsi by default, and make it an option
	  on the export dialog.  ps2epsi can take really really long
	  sometimes, generate large files, and most of the time I found out
	  you don't want it anyway.
	
	* src/eval.c: fix 64 bit build

Sat Oct 09 12:23:07 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am: apply patch from Dominique Leuenberger
	  (dominique at leuenberger dot net) to fix build on Make 3.82

Thu Oct 07 12:38:44 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l: note that [^?] is may include newlines,
	  must explicitly exclude them

	* src/gnome-genius.c:  Add a trailing newline to programs unless
	  given.  Fixes parse errors at end of file if ends on a comment
	  or a lexer rule which expects endofline

Thu Sep 30 15:28:50 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel: Fix CrossProduct and
	  make it return a column vector.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add a test

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: note that the result is a column
	  vector

Thu Sep 09 22:47:54 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.11

	* src/gnome-genius.desktop.in: add %U to command line

	* help/C/genius.xml: some minor updates and clarifications

Thu Sep 09 21:29:33 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/calc.h, src/gnome-genius.c:  In a fit of
	  incredible evilness (or stupidity) somebody made <term.h>
	  #define buttons ... thinking buttons is an uncommon word.
	  Yaikes.  Wonder why it doesn't break on Fedora but it did break on
	  SuSE.  Anyway, thanks go to Stephan Hegel for hunting this one
	  down!

Wed Sep 08 00:48:15 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.10

Wed Sep 08 00:47:50 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: require Gtk+ 2.14 and VTE 0.17.1

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/graphing.c, ve/ve-miscui.c: fix some
	  sealing things.  Do note that we do not yet compile even without
	  deprecated stuff since gtkextra is full of it.  Also use some newer
	  things that required gtk+ 2.14 and vte 0.17.1

	* src/graphing.c: fix zooming in 2D plots when moving mouse
	  in any direction.

Mon Aug 30 22:33:08 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.h, ssrc/funclib.c, src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c:
	  update copyright string and make it translatable

Mon Aug 30 15:31:37 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml, help/C/gel-function-list.xml:
	  Hand apply some changes from Christian Kirbach
	  (christian.kirbach at googlemail dot com) to fix typos

	* lib/*/*.gel, src/funclib.c:  Fix some typos.  Fix spelling of the
	  function name AuxiliaryUnitMatrix!

Mon Aug 30 14:43:41 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c, configure.in: Apply patch from
	  Jan de Groot jan at jgc.homeip.net to port the GnomeVFS stuff
	  to GIO.  This raises the glib requirement to 2.16 for the gnome
	  version.  When built without gnome then 2.12 is all that is needed
	  still.

Mon Aug 30 13:41:49 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: ExpandMatrix,SetMatrixSize,ColumnsOf,RowsOf,
	  IsMatrix* accept null as the input (0x0) matrix and act accordingly

	* src/geniustests.txt: Add tests

Mon Aug 30 13:28:23 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: Add "legend" style parameter to LinePlotDrawLine

	* lib/equation_solving/diffeqs.gel: Add RungeKuttaFull and
	  EulersMethodFull which return all points computed (and slightly
	  optimize Runge-Kutta)
	
	* src/geniustests.txt, help/C/*.xml: update

Mon Aug 30 10:23:49 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: Patch from Vincent Untz to fix access to sealed
	  vte structure members

Tue Jun 29 11:38:38 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: Add SurfacePlotVariableNames and some fixes

	* help/C/*.xml: document above and some fixes

Tue Jun 29 11:11:04 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: allow changing variable names for surfaces when
	  plotting from a dialog

Sat Feb 27 16:57:50 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: check events every time we get something from
	  readline.  That way, the new line from "return" is truly
	  synchroneous.  (it was in the wrong place for commands, even though
	  for expression this already got fixed)

Wed Feb 03 00:10:42 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: when drawing slopefield solutions, allow the graph
	  to leave window by a small fudge factor of 1/100 of the window size

	* gtkextra/gtkplot.c, gtkextra/gtkplot3d.c: add some sanity fixes to
	  fix crashes on tick calculations when the supplied data is less
	  than sane.  The tick calculation stuff is very evil and there are
	  still some crashes around when doing insensible things with 
	  graphs.

Tue Feb 02 21:42:42 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix compilation when gtksourceview is disabled

Tue Feb 02 13:30:44 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: Allow changing variable names.  Either in the GUI
	  or using the new parameter LinePlotVariableNames.

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: document the new parameter

Tue Feb 02 10:32:53 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c, help/C/gel-function-list.xml: Add SlopefieldTicks
	  and VectorfieldTicks, to allow setting ticks from the command line.

Wed Jan 27 00:52:13 2010  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.h, src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/funclib.c:
	  Implement AskButtons interactive function which asks the user to
	  select from a list of buttons.

	* src/eval.c: allow comparisons (only == and !=) with null.  We
	  really want to treat null as an empty matrix.  null is only
	  equal to null itself of course.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests for null comparisons

	* help/C/genius.xml, help/C/gel-function-list.xml: Document
	  AskButtons

Wed Dec 23 15:41:42 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.9

Wed Dec 23 15:18:56 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: fix minor leak

	* src/eval.c: fix MEM_DEBUG_FRIENDLY compilation

Wed Dec 23 14:09:21 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c, src/util.c: fix use of strcpy

Thu Dec 10 17:00:49 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: fix matrix expansion.  After zeros were replaced
	  the expression [0,I(2);0,0] would not include the last row.  This
	  fixes AuxilliaryUnitMatrix and JordanBlock functions.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests for matrix expansion and the
	  above functions

Tue Nov 10 00:30:53 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.8

Tue Nov 10 00:19:56 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: require gtk/glib 2.12

	* src/gnome-genius.c: use the "new" GtkTooltip api

	* src/eval.c: remove unused function

Mon Oct 19 15:59:28 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Patches from: Yaakov (Cygwin/X) yselkowitz at users dot sourceforge
        dot net

	* configure.in: add EXEEXT to fix building on cygwin

	* ve/Makefile.am: Fix parallel builds

Sun Oct 18 20:05:43 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: check events before executing a command line.
	  VTE behaviour changed and we need to make sure the user carriage
	  return gets sent to screen before the execution.

Thu Sep 24 15:48:25 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml: some doc updates

Wed Jul 29 15:11:16 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.7

	* src/gnome-genius.c: set all toolbar items to important so
	  that text always shows.

Tue Jul 28 14:04:33 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* NEWS: update,

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: add more docs on the root finding
	  functions.  There aren't very nice, but ...

	* lib/equation_solving/find_root.gel: use true/false for booleans
	  rather than 0/1

Mon Jul 27 15:22:57 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml, help/C/gel-function-list.xml: Update
	  documentation for all the new features and improve existing
	  parts a bit especially by adding a bunch of links for some
	  functions.

	* NEWS: update

Fri Jul 24 17:23:04 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/calculus/fourier.gel: fix cosine series and fix argument
	  checking on the fourier function creation

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/testfourier.gel: add tests for the
	  fourier functions

	* src/graphing.c: the create plot and plot dialogs are stupid as
	  dialogs because of the way metacity handles dialogs (annoyingly
	  as "keep above parent") so set the hint to normal.

Fri Jul 24 16:32:32 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/calculus/fourier.gel: add NumericalFourierCosineSeriesFunction
	  and NumericalFourierSineSeriesFunction and fixup some doc strings

	* src/eval.c, src/dict.c: build the subst_dict on first function
	  evaluate.  This avoids subst lists for simple functions, plus
	  it makes the global identifier no-substitution behaviour slightly
	  more easy to see.

Fri Jul 24 16:01:28 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c, src/compil.c: Correctly compile/decompile all the new
	  function attributes

	* src/calc.c: correctly print out the local stuff, handle local node
	  correctly when outside of functions

	* src/funclib.c, src/graphing.c: handle eof errors from parsing
	  things correctly without dying.

	* src/dict.c, src/eval.c, src/structs.h: is_local generally should
	  not be moved around with the function.  Also correctly copy/free
	  all the other attributes when needed as well.

	* src/eval.c: Set arguments BEFORE extradict.  This should never
	  be an issue, but it feels more correct.

	* src/dict.c: when the subst list becomes empty, remove from subst
	  list to avoid unnecessary lookups

	* lib/*/*.gel: update and fix for the [] operator

	* src/geniustests.txt: Add some testcases

	* src/symbolic.c: just a comment change

Thu Jul 23 18:35:28 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y, src/eval.c, src/dict.c, src/structs.h: Add an optional
	  list of extra_dict parameters to function definition.  In this
	  case the subst dance never happens and those variables are added to
	  extra dict at function definition time.

	* lib/*/*.gel: Use local where appropriate and the [] extra dict
	  definition where appropriate

	* src/testscope.gel, src/geniustests.txt: update test suite

	* src/geniustest.pl: fix colors

Thu Jul 23 16:28:59 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/dict.c, src/eval.c: remove some forgotten debug prints

	* src/eval.c: do not allow setting a new parameter over a protected
	  id

	* src/funclib.c: Add UserVariables function

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/testscope.gel: add new tests

Thu Jul 23 12:26:47 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: Add UndefineAll, ProtectAll, make Undefine an alias
	  for undefine.

	* src/dict.[ch], src/eval.c: allow setting of protected parameters,
	  they just can't be deleted or changed

	* lib/*.gel: Use the ProtectAll function

	* src/testscope.gel: add extra tests

Wed Jul 22 14:44:10 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version, require slightly newer glib (2.10)

	* src/compil.c, src/dict.[ch], src/eval.[ch], src/lexer.l,
	  src/parse.y, src/parseutil.[ch], src/structs.h:  Add local
	  variables (not seen by higher contexts).  Also fix several minor
	  issues relating to dictionaries and lookup, mainly subst list
	  function is not substituted again if it is passed up and down the
	  contexts, and substitution is done in a smarter way.

	* src/dict.[ch], src/gnome-genius.c: Redo the way contexts are done
	  to get rid of some gslists

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: allocate new real nums in a smarter way (by large
	  blocks) and put no limit on the number of real number structures
	  on the free list.

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/testscope.gel:  Add scope tests

Wed Jul 22 00:30:36 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: update for newest info from
	  GIMPS.  Also fix MersennePrimeExponents (it had 3 columns by
	  mistake)

Fri Jul 10 14:53:41 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/figures/genius_window.png, help/C/figures/line_plot.png,
	  help/C/figures/line_plot_graph.png, help/C/figures/parametric.png,
	  help/C/figures/parametric_graph.png,
	  help/C/figures/surface_graph.png, pixmaps/32x32/gnome-genius.png,
	  pixmaps/48x48/gnome-genius.png, pixmaps/genius-graph.png:
	  Optimize PNGs

Thu Apr 23 01:32:06 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: Fix opening new files from the command line.
	  It just works now.

	* lib/calculus/Makefile.am, lib/calculus/fourier.gel:  Add some
	  Fourier series routines.  This currently exposes a bug in scoping
	  rules

Sun Apr 19 19:27:09 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/testprec.gel: test the precision stuff

	* src/graphing.c: Apply patch from Matthias Drochner of NetBSD to
	  fix uninitialized variable in one dimensional function plots

Sun Apr 19 18:55:12 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: Fix conflict with changing precision and the mpfr
	  cache.  Also fix a possible extra negation error in pow_z.

Fri Apr 03 15:42:40 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: joins and caps are round.  Fixes bad looking joins
	  on graphs of quickly oscillating functions

Sun Mar 15 00:04:08 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.6

Sun Mar 15 00:01:20 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/*.[ch]: do much interface cleanup again.

Mon Mar 09 16:48:03 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/*.[ch]: lots of cleanup plus bin compat breakage for plugins:
	  Moved many things to the gel_ or genius_ namespace for consistency
	  sake.  There aren't actually any plugins that I know of so, who
	  cares if this all changes.  Plus bin compat is already broken this
	  release, as it does almost every other release

	* src/funclib.c: accept opposite orientation interval for
	  CompositeSimpsonsRule

	* src/geniustests.txt: update tests

Thu Mar 05 01:47:55 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: LinePlotDrawLegends parameter actually updates
	  the legends drawing in real time.  Don't store the parameter value
	  as an extra.

	* src/graphing.c: always update spinboxes before plotting something
	  not just on activate.

Wed Mar 04 23:58:43 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: add two more style strings to LinePlotDrawLine.
	  First "window" can set the window, with a "fit" being a fitting
	  window.  Also allow drawing of arrows by "arrow" followed by
	  "end", "both", "origin", "none" (done in canvas coordinates, not
	  screen coordinates, not ideal, try zooming)
	
	* src/graphing.c, src/funclib.c: a bit of cleanup, some pointless
	  optimizations, and make sure the graphing functions don't get
	  called during plotting.  Also setting LinePlotWindow,
	  SurfacePlotWindow will change zoom immediately as one would expect

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: update

Mon Mar 02 02:38:40 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* **/Makefile.am: implement profile-generate and profile-use
	  target for profile guided optimization.  Not quite all working
	  I don't think, but simple tests produce impressive results.

	* gtkextra/gtkplotflux.c: fix bad use of snprintf

Mon Mar 02 02:07:52 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix bad drawing of very vertical functions.  Our
	  new hack in gtkextra handles lines way off screen more sanely so
	  we needn't worry much here.

Fri Feb 27 14:42:12 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/funclib.c: remove the dependence on the MPF
	  compat layer.  Inline a few more functions.  Implement mpwl_eql
	  to make comparisons of rationals quicker.  Remove certain old
	  gmp/mpfr bug workarounds, a bit of cleanup

	* src/matop.c: in the mul_sub_row, cache the tmp variable for
	  greater speed.

Thu Feb 26 18:40:16 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: don't kill newlines in descriptions.  This is no longer
	  a problem.  Further reduces startup time by a tiny bit.

Thu Feb 26 02:34:54 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: fix crash of string dumping

Thu Feb 26 02:27:06 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c, src/calc.c, src/dict.[ch], src/gnome-genius.h,
	  src/structs.h, src/symbolic.c: store uncompiled string in the
	  token, not in a separate hash table.  This avoids extra lookups
	  during startup.

	* src/calc.c: a bit more optimization for help initialization

Thu Feb 26 00:54:16 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: handle crashes of the readline-helper without
	  hanging.  Slight reorganization of startup to show window few
	  nanoseconds faster.  Also don't use gtk_show_uri yet.  This
	  causes backwards binary incompatibility which sucks as my other
	  laptop uses hardy.

	* src/calc.c: slight improvement in help handling.  Don't sort
	  the functions in the categories until we really need to.

	* src/dict.c: when checking for similar id's do the sum and a square
	  sum to check for reorderings.  This fixes the strange suggestions
	  sometimes

	* src/genius-readline-helper.c: avoid crashes on getting SIGINT, ignore

Tue Feb 24 22:05:41 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/gtkplotdata.c, gtkextra/gtkplotgdk.c: Move the line
	  clipping code from the GDK backend to the plotdata.  Replace
	  the one relevant draw_lines call with the new one.  I wonder
	  if this should be done in more places.  This is a mess!
	  There are still bugs if you zoom in way too much.  Not quite sure
	  what the bug is.  We may need to actually move the endpoints 
	  of the line.  This fixes broken EPS/PS export and printing
	  when zoomed in to a slopefield/vectorfield/parametric graph.

Tue Feb 24 01:35:34 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: use gtkextra clipping of lines

	* gtkextra/*.c: apply patches from cvs gtkextra

	* gtkextra/gtkplotgdk.c: fix drawing of lines which have parts which
	  are very far offscreen.  Need to push this logic higher up the stack
	  since such lines also kill the postscript output.

	* src/graphing.c: remove some pointless allocation of point
	  arrays.

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/graphing.c: fix menu accelerators

Mon Feb 23 11:01:10 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix the extra precision calculations to work 
	  for increments of 2.5.  Also try a tiny bit harder to get more
	  than 3 ticks

Sun Feb 22 00:00:04 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: clip slopefield solutions to within the plot window.
	  to avoid unsightly overshooting lines when step size is too large
	  (or when slope is too large)

Sat Feb 21 03:12:36 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: after ps/eps export queue draw on the plot canvas
	  because it for some reason needs it

Thu Feb 19 23:48:45 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius_lists.c, src/inter.c, src/genius-readline-helper.c: fixup
	  operator list, remove the param list since params have toplevel
	  function nodes nowadays (for better part of a decade already :)

Thu Feb 19 23:19:37 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: set prgname and application_name
	  for glib

Thu Feb 19 20:33:26 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* ve/ve-miscui.[ch]: remove the option menu func since option menu is
	  deprecated anyway

	* src/gnome-genius.c: use g_idle_add instead of gtk_idle_add

Wed Feb 18 00:28:12 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: handle read only files properly.  Also verify 
	  text to be proper utf8 before inserting it into the text entry.
	  And the notebook now has a right click menu to switch between
	  programs.

	* src/graphing.c, gtkextra/gtkplotcanvas.c: avoid spurious draws
	  during new plots to avoid flicker when several LinePlot actions
	  are done in sequence.  Also fix gtkextra to honour the freeze 
	  in child draw.

Tue Feb 17 17:35:44 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix the scales on the axis (the precision was
	  reversed!)

	* src/graphing.c: draw the x/y axis and a dotted grid in grey.  This
	  really improves readability I think.  This should be configurable I
	  guess.

	* src/funclib.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/genius.c: allow setting
	  default for AskString as second argument

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: update

Mon Feb 16 01:27:46 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix some strings

Mon Feb 16 01:09:16 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: add padding to string query dialogs.  Add stock
	  plot icon

	* pixmaps/*/genius-stock-plot.png: Draw a simple plot icon for the
	  menu/toolbar

Mon Feb 16 00:11:29 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/plugin.c: minor fixes.  Display help for
	  plugin loading, don't do lazy binding (can lead to stupid crashes,
	  better just not load bad plugins) also pass the LOCAL flag to
	  plugins to be safer.

	* src/Makefile.am: add the NOGUI libs to gnome-genius.  That will
	  make plugins work again

Sun Feb 15 20:05:05 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, src/gnome-genius.c: small cleanup

Sun Feb 15 19:50:15 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix tlen default (to be 5 not 0.1), tinc default is
	  set according to tlen

Sun Feb 15 18:51:42 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: Add solver dialog to vectorfields.  Also add
	  VectorfieldDrawSolution and VectorfieldClearSolutions.  Also draw
	  arrows with proper arrows not triangles.  Change default to not
	  normalize arrow length, that's better default I think.

	* help/C/genius.xml, help/C/gel-function-list.xml: update

	* ve/ve-nongnome.c: remove some unused functions

Sun Feb 15 15:18:20 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version

	* configure.in, src/gnome-genius.c: finish the de-libgnome(ui)ization
	  And remove the libgnome(ui) dep.  Removes 14 libs from the output
	  of 'ldd'

	* ve/viciousui.h: remove libgnome include

Sun Feb 15 11:25:47 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: in the event hook, handle events until all
	  handled, fixes "hangs" or extreme ui slowdowns
	  when event hook is not run often enough

	* ve/ve-miscui.[ch]: steal gtk_dialog_run and do
	  ve_dialog_run_nonmodal.  This way we can interrupt a tight loop
	  with AskString's in it

	* src/gnome-genius.c: start implementing a window with GtkUIManager
	  to get rid of libgnomeui dep.

Fri Feb 13 14:51:43 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: use gtk_show_uri to show help
	  when gtk is high enough version

Fri Feb 13 13:59:11 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/graphing.c, src/gnome-genius.h src/genius.c:
	  some more delibgnome(ui)ification

Fri Feb 13 13:29:35 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* ve/ve-misc.c, ve/ve-misc.h, ve/ve-gnome.c, ve/ve-nongnome.c,
	  ve/ve-config.c:  remove ve_find_prog_in_path and
	  ve_i18n_get_language_list, those have analogs in glib now
	  ve_is_prog_in_path now doesn't take the extra path argument,
	  gdm needed that somewhere and ve is only for genius now.

	* src/graphing.c: use ve_is_prog_in_path in the new way

	* configure.in: require glib 2.6.0 as well

Fri Feb 13 13:08:55 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, ve/Makefile.am: do not compile glade-helper,
	  we don't need glade thus kill the libglade dep

	* configure.in: require GTK 2.6.0 (yeah way behind times)

	* src/gnome-genius.c: exorcise some libgnome/ui demons.  get rid of
	  gnome_help_* and gnome_config_* and gnome_about*  One more step
	  towards getting rid of this dep

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: when binreloc gets us the wrong
	  dir do not use it.  Use the default compiled in dir as backup.

Tue Feb 10 16:43:08 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, NEWS: raise version update NEWS

	* src/mpwrap.c: fix leak in multiply

	* src/mpwrap.c: fix a leak and fix a buffer overrun (Thanks to
	  Simon Munton simon-genius at munton.demon.co.uk)

	* lib/equation_solving/diffeqs.gel: Fix EulersMethod (it was
	  overshooting by one increment)  Also EulersMethod and RungeKutta
	  now solve system by just accepting vectors for y

	* src/geniustests.txt: add new tests for EulersMethod

	* help/C/genius.xml, help/C/gel-function-list.xml: Update
	  documentation, fix EulersMethod doc by using the right id string.

Sun Feb 08 00:21:32 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.4

Sun Feb 08 00:09:50 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: make sure the x and y point spinboxes are updated
	  when we click on the canvas to draw a solution

Tue Feb 03 00:00:11 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix typo (not adding a new string, in fact just
	  getting rid of a bad one, the good one is already in the
	  translations)

Mon Feb 02 23:40:32 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix typo, it is dy/dx not dx/dy.  Also fix the
	  slopefield vectorfield sizing stuff to actually get it right in
	  every aspect.  I.e., scale to uniform size AFTER converting to
	  pixels, DUH!

Mon Feb 02 01:11:11 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix the plot scale precision (especially for y).  
	  When we just click on the plot do zoom in instead of zoom into an
	  incredibly small window.  And finally make the create plot window
	  usable on a netbook by adding a scrollwindow on small screens
	  for the lineplot tab.

Sun Feb 01 10:54:30 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix typo thanks to Daniel Nylander

Sun Feb 01 00:11:32 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: do Runge-Kutta instead of Euler for the graphical
	  slopefield solver.  Whack VectorfieldCPlot (never implemented,
	  should not be a separate function anyway).  Implement
	  VectorfieldPlot and SlopefieldPlot.

	* help/C/genius.xml, help/C/gel-function-list.xml: update for all
	  the new changes

Sat Jan 31 18:44:38 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: resolve some GtkExtra nonsense (dx and dy for flux
	  are specified in pixels, that is some serious crack!) so that
	  slope/vector fields draw correctly in non-aspect zoom.  Implement
	  the "clear solutions" functions and included a GUI.  Implement
	  a solver dialog and implement "clicky-solutions" when the dialog
	  is ON.

Sat Jan 31 09:42:58 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: it turns out the gmp cmp functions can return other
	  values than -1,0,1.  So normalize on the mpw_cmp* level.  This
	  broke for loops that started at negative numbers.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests for the for loops starting at
	  negative values

	* src/graphing.c: fixup the tick size for slopefield and vectorfield
	  Implement stubs for the GEL interface to all of these, allow
	  setting the increment in SlopefieldDrawSolution

	* src/calc.h: update the COPYRIGHT_STRING

Fri Jan 30 18:30:30 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix some leaks.  Implement a simple euler method
	  graphical solver for the slopefield.  Currently it is only
	  accessible by a temporary function just to see if it works.  It
	  needs a proper interface and also a UI interface.
	  Slopefield/Vectorfield do not yet have proper GEL interface either

Mon Jan 26 23:59:06 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: Finish the GUI plotting of vectorfield and
	  slopefield, fix a leak on parametric plots, stretch out the labels
	  in the dialogs to make things fit better and look nicer.

Fri Dec 05 23:17:22 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: raise the plot window on gui actions (pressing the
	  plot button) if it exists.  Add a "Reset to original zoom" menuitem.

Wed Nov 19 00:29:04 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel:  Add Eigenvectors.
	  Currently only for 2x2 matrices where computing eigenvectors is
	  relatively easy

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: add Eigenvectors

Fri Nov 14 00:29:17 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: slopefield works from GUI in a very rudimentary way

Sun Nov 09 23:33:04 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: another step forwards towards implementation of
	  slope fields and vector fields graphs.  UI is pretty much
	  implemented.  But it doesn't do anything yet.

Thu Nov 06 00:00:28 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: a tiny bit of cleanup, start implementing
	  slopefield/vectorfield graphing support.

Tue Nov 04 00:46:40 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: add checkbutton to allow for no legends on the
	  lineplot, useful if I want to just draw myself on the graphs

Tue Nov 04 00:19:54 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix warning

	* src/graphing.c: fix warning, handle error on print command, fix
	  bad labling of functions if some functions cannot be parsed or are
	  empty.

Mon Sep 22 23:23:51 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: rename parse/eval to Parse and Evaluate to be
	  more in line with my in-vogue naming in Genius (no need to
	  break the consistency even further)

	* src/calc.h, src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/funclib.c:
	  Implement function AskString to interactively ask for a string.
	  Use a dialog in GUI mode and readline in command line mode

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: update

Mon Sep 22 00:05:25 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version

	* src/funclib.c: Add 'parse' and 'eval' functions

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: add 'parse' and 'eval' blurbs

	* src/calc.c, src/genius-readline-helper.c, src/gnome-genius.c:
	  handle return values of chdir, getcwd, write, pipe properly

	* src/funclib.c, src/genius.c: move manual display out of funclib.c
	  and make it less hackish, and use less or more if available to
	  display manual for the text mode version.

	* src/funclib.c: correctly call the gel_errorout function to avoid
	  crashes from calling "error"

Sun Sep 21 17:50:50 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: Update the Mersenne prime info
	  to include the two newest ones.

Tue Jun 10 12:25:17 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: minor typo fix

Tue Jun 10 09:18:46 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.3

Sat Jun 07 13:02:21 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/matop.c, src/funclib.c, src/eval.c: Add a new flag to not do
	  backsubstitution in gauss if we are interested in nullspace and
	  the matrix is nonsingular
	
	* src/matop.c: fix the return value of gauss.  Singular means
	  nonempty nullspace, i.e. maximal row rank.  This also fixes
	  SolveLinearSystem which didn't work according to specs, i.e. it is
	  supposed to return null when solution is nonunique.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add more tests

Thu Jun 05 11:40:58 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: fix argument checking in MillerRabin.  Also
	  zeros, ones, rand, randint, I, SetMatrixSize now accept 0 for size
	  and return null as an empty matrix.  Also wait, IndexComplement
	  accept 0 and work accordingly.
	
	* help/C/gel-function-list.gel: update accordingly

Wed Jun 04 11:56:25 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml, help/C/gel-function-list.gel: update the docs
	  a little, fix a few typos, add links.

Wed Jun 04 03:51:25 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: figure out a way to work around VTE nonsense,
	  one way to get at current absolute row is by checking the cursor
	  location and assuming it is on the last line.  Improve
	  monitoring by using a text buffer and allow to turn off the 
	  automatic updates.  Full answer is now wrapped if not a matrix.
	  Don't set icon if it doesn't exist to avoid warning.  Don't try
	  to use readline helper from current dir if not in dev dir.

Tue Jun 03 20:14:34 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix some capitalization issues, implement
	  a variable monitor dialog.  Also add code to save current console
	  but that is disabled due to VTE having useless (read: unusable)
	  API for getting at the buffer.  You require some private knowledge
	  to use the get_text_range function.  Otherwise the API is
	  pointless.

Thu May 22 01:10:40 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: fix identity matrix caching, setup type caches for
	  identity, zeros and ones

	* src/matop.c: move rref caching to gauss to speed up inverting
	  matrices in rref form etc...

Tue May 20 02:36:47 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: update slightly the upper bound on
	  double checked mersenne prime exponents to newest value

Tue May 20 00:25:10 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/matrixw.[ch], matop.c, src/eval.c, src/funclib.c:  Optimize
	  matrix manipulation a bit.  Don't be overly conservative with
	  making things private.  And OMG we used Gauss-Jordan instead of
	  backaddition.  Also when the matrix is not rational, do pivotting
	  (use largest entry, not first nonzero one)

	* src/mpwrap.c: fix mpw_abs if called with same arguments for in and
	  out and add mpw_abs_sq for getting the absolute value squared,
	  which doesn't involve a sqrt

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/eval.[ch], src/matrixw.c: 
	  init the_zero during the startup

	* src/mpzextra.c: very minor optimizations

	* src/Makefile.am: fix BUILDDIR setup

Mon May 19 19:56:37 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpzextra.c: fix leak on mympz_is_prime.

Sun Feb 24 18:38:31 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/genius.xml: update

Sun Feb 24 18:35:45 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: print extra dict of a function by printing a list
	  of variable assignments before the function body.

	* src/dict.c: a little cleanup and fix the problem with subst list
	  updating and d_replacefunc which happened when a local variable
	  which was previously set to something else was set to a function.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add more tests on returning functions
	  and the subst list handling

	* help/C/genius.xml: add section on returning functions from
	  functions

Sun Feb 24 15:25:45 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/dict.c, src/funclib.c: Add IsDefined and undefine.  Implement
	  d_delete.  protect and unprotect now work with matrices of
	  identifiers.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests

	* help/C/*.xml: update docs

	* TODO: problems with subst lists can lead to crash, document this

Fri Feb 22 02:44:23 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c, src/mpwrap.c: avoid warning

Fri Feb 22 02:41:35 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/*.[ch]: update copyright string as appropriate

Fri Feb 22 02:11:03 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel:  Add IsMersennePrime and
	  MersennePrimeExponents

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml, help/C/genius.xml: document the above

Fri Feb 22 01:38:54 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: add mpw_re_sgn and mpw_im_sgn functions and fix
	  memory leak in mpw_re and mpw_im

	* src/funclib.c: Implement QuadraticFormula internally, marginally
	  improving performance, but mainly handle special cases better
	  and avoid instability in solutions (avoid bad cancellation in most
	  cases)

	* lib/equation_solving/formulas.gel: remove QuadraticFormula from
	  here

	* src/longtest.gel: add tests for quadratic formula

Sat Jan 12 15:03:19 2008  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: make internal function calling a bit faster.  Can be
	  noticeable (tested 10% on fast operations)

	* src/funclib.c: fix memory leak

Thu Nov 29 10:34:41 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/gel-function-list.gel, lib/combinatorics/misc.gel:  Fix
	  spelling of the Fibonacci function name.

Tue Nov 20 23:20:58 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.2

Tue Nov 20 23:13:36 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: no mod of arguments to round, ceil, trunc, all trig
	  functions, all log functions, exp, CompositeSimpsonsRule.  It
	  just doesn't make sense to do so.  Fix IsPerfectSquare for
	  rationals.

Tue Nov 20 12:26:58 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: one more untranslated string marked

Tue Nov 20 03:34:28 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: set up our icon on all windows

Tue Nov 20 03:22:14 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: saner algorithm to figure out when to print in
	  scientific notation

Tue Nov 20 02:33:03 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version

	* src/gnome-genius.c: don't leave behind zombie processes from
	  running programs.  Translate a previously untranslated string,
	  and handle fork failing.

	* src/eval.c: the @() operator accepts null as range when not used
	  as an lvalue and just returns null then.  That's the more
	  correct behaviour, treating it as an empty range, thus returning
	  an empty matrix.  Plus negligible speed improvement.

	* src/calc.c: kill extraneous newline when prettyprinting fractions

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests

	* NEWS: update

2007-11-20  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>

	* src/gnome-genius.desktop.in: Fix category and mimetype fields
	  of the desktop file.

2007-11-19  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>

	* help/omf.make: And now fix the OMF file installation if
	  --disable-scrollkeeper is used for real.

2007-11-19  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>

	* help/omf.make: Fix OMF file installation if --disable-scrollkeeper
	  is used.

Mon Nov 19 03:21:44 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c, src/funclib.c: slight optimization by using
	  mpfr_zero_p

Mon Nov 19 02:56:58 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/symbolic.c: add erf derivative

Sun Nov 18 14:48:56 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix building with no gtksourceview 

Sat Nov 17 21:27:26 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: use GTK_STOCK_DIALOG_INFO instead of
	  GTK_STOCK_INFO, as the latter is only available in 2.8 and higher
	  gtk, thus making genius implicitly depend on 2.8

	* ve/Makefile.am: don't use -l to link to the viciouslib but link it
	  directly

Fri Nov 16 23:36:57 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.1

Fri Nov 16 23:10:29 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/gtkplot.[ch]: add freeze/thaw functions since otherwise
	  we may hang and eat all memory on recalculating ticks needlessly
	  when changing both range and ticks.

	* src/graphing.c: use freeze/thaw to avoid hangs and huge memory
	  leaks.  On parametric plots, squish the graph a little and move
	  the legend below the plot.

	* NEWS: update

Fri Nov 16 00:50:48 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/calculus/sums_proucts.gel: increase default sum and product
	  tries to 10000, since 200 was just not cutting it.

Thu Nov 15 23:30:51 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: Much nicer pretty printing of matrices.  Rather
	  than using tabs, use commas and align elements successive rows.
	  Both nicer, more readable (when MixedFractions is on) and more
	  compact way of seeing matrices.  Yay!

	* src/lexer.l: drop the tab support for entering matrices.  Not only
	  was it stupid, it didn't work on the command line

	* src/funclib.c: fix print, printn and display functions to not follow
	  the line length limits like normal output

	* src/calc.c: when pretty printing a matrix, only print the leading
	  newline if we are not in fact on the start of a line

	* configure.in: check for svn rather than cvs to add extra warnings

	* src/gnome-genius.c: make is_uri static to avoid a warning

	* help/C/genius.xml: update the manual

	* NEWS: update

Thu Nov 15 18:39:06 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: add nullspacetest.gel

Wed Nov 14 20:13:29 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/matop.c: fix possible memory corruption in the gauss
	  routine

	* src/matrixw.c: slight optimization to not copy zeros

	* src/funclib.c, lib/linear_algebra/*.gel: Implement NullSpace
	  and PivotColumns internally for speed.

	* src/gnome-genius.c: remove some unused vars

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/nullspacetests.txt: add tests for
	  PivotColumns and NullSpace

Wed Nov 14 04:15:49 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/*.gel: OrthogonalComplement is with respect
	  to Hermitian product just like everything else.  Also
	  handle null as empty matrix/subspace in more places.

Wed Nov 14 03:45:42 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/matop.c, src/symbolic.c, src/mpwrap.[ch], src/calc.c,
	  src/funclib.c, src/eval.c: Significantly improve both
	  memory usage and speed in matrix multiplication and to some degree
	  Gaussian elimination in case there are a lot of zero entries.

	* src/geniustests.txt: update

Tue Nov 13 23:48:25 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/matrixw.[ch], src/calc.c, src/funclib.c, src/matop.c,
	  src/symbolic.c, src/compil.c, src/eval.c: Optimized / cleaned up
	  certain matrix operations a tiny bit.  Consistently traverse
	  matrices row wise.

	* src/funclib.c, src/eval.c: Fixed and slightly optimized IsIn,
	  it used to bomb if the first argument was a matrix, and it
	  used to think that the object "true" is equal to any number,
	  and further it didn't see a difference between numbers of
	  different types (float vs. integer).  This fixes also Intersection,
	  Union, MakeSet and SetMinus.  Also added IsSubset.  Also fixed
	  symbolic tree comparison for matrices.

	* src/mpwrap.c: When printing out a floating point number, make sure
	  to append ".0" to the end to distinguish it from an integer

	* src/geniustests.txt:  updated tests, added many new tests.

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: updated

	* NEWS: update

Sun Nov 11 03:17:49 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: translate the author fields in the about box
	  and set the program name correctly

Sun Nov 11 03:07:04 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: there was a stupid string to translate

Sun Nov 11 00:14:04 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am: add genius-graph.png to EXTRA_DIST

	* src/funclib.c: Implement DividePoly to divide polynomials
	  using long division.  This was one of those things that
	  I set aside to do "tommorrow" and it took close to a decade.

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: document DividePoly

	* configure.in: require GTK+ 2.4 (not 2.3.5 as previously)

	* NEWS: update

Sat Nov 10 16:58:14 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: migrate to GtkFontButton and add website addy
	  to about box

Sat Nov 10 16:22:09 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: optionally use GtkAboutDialog if we have GTK
	2.6 and higher

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/genius.c, src/Makefile.am: better checking
	if we are in the development directory and if so, don't init binreloc
	and use the local lib.cgel

Sat Nov 10 13:51:26 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix fit dependent axis zoom for parametric plots

	* src/dict.[ch], src/gnome-genius.c, src/eval.c: Add names to
	  contexts and print these when showing local variables so that you
	  can see the "backtrace".  Also the display of vars is slightly
	  nicer now.

Thu Nov 08 00:51:16 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/genius.c, src/funclib.c, src/plugin.c,
	  src/lexer.l, src/binreloc.[ch], acinclude.m4, src/Makefile.am:
	  add and use Binreloc code from autopackage to allow relocatable
	  executables.  Slightly massaged the code/auto* stuff to make it
	  work.

Mon Nov 05 01:31:51 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am: add the INSTALL.MacOSX file to EXTRA_DIST

Mon Nov 05 00:15:09 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.[ch], src/mpwrap.[ch], src/funclib.c, src/genius.c,
	  src/gnome-genius.c, src/structs.h src/geloutput.[ch]:  Implement
	  OutputChopExponent and OutputChopWhenExponent parameters.  These
	  will chop small numbers if they appear near large numbers.

	* src/gnome-genius.c: try to use G_DIR_SEPARATOR more just in case
	  someone will start porting genius

	* help/C/*.xml: update documentation for chopping

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests for chopping

	* README, NEWS: update

Sun Nov 04 02:37:58 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: unswap x and y.  They are now in correct positive
	  orientation in gtkextra.

	* src/gnome-genius.c, pixmaps/gnome-graph.png: add a simple "logo"
	  to the about box

	* NEWS: update

Sat Nov 03 20:51:37 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: Use -10 to 10 for all default ranges.  Much better
	  than PI, that was stupid.  Set minimum plot window to 1e-10 and
	  enforce it to avoid errors with computing ticks leading to
	  hanging behaviour.

	* gtkextra/*: copy new files from cvs version of gtk extra except
	  for gtkplotps which is broken, so keep our old version which works

	* gtkextra/gtkplot3d.[ch]: fix up the axis mess

	* src/graphing.c: use the new gtk extra stuff.  Produces nicer
	  plots on screen.  Initial patch was by Sebastian Dröge
	  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>

2007-11-03  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>

	* configure.in:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/gnome-genius.c: (get_source_language_manager), (new_program):
	Optionally allow to use GtkSourceView2 instead of GtkSourceView1.
	Version 2 is preferred if available, otherwise version 1 will be used.

2007-11-03  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.in:
	* help/omf.make:
	Add --disable-scrollkeeper and --disable-update-mimedb options to
	configure to skip building the scrollkeeper and mime database on
	make install. The files generated by this must not be shipped by
	binary packages and having this options makes it easier to package
	genius.

Wed Oct 31 10:43:25 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/*: remove gtkplotdtriangle.[ch]: they're not needed and
	  have a bad license.

Fri Oct 26 02:16:23 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.[ch], src/eval.[ch], src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c:
	  Implement maximum node checking.  If the limit is hit you are
	  given a chance to interrupt the current program.  Only in the
	  GNOME version.  Add this to the Properties dialog.

	* src/dict.c: Fix large performance problem on returning from a deep
	  recursion by not doing a stupid assert

	* help/C/genius.xml: document max_nodes

Thu Oct 25 15:22:16 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/inter.c: fix command line editting.  readline docs are
	  horrible! (and readline is horrible)

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix strange printing of locals among globals

Thu Oct 25 13:47:40 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/dict.[ch]: Implement showing of all user
	  variables even during runtime.  Shows even local variables if some
	  function is currently being executed.  Allows better debugging

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix show full answer leak and fix running it
	  during runtime.

	* configure.in: bump version

	* help/C/genius.xml: update docs a bit, add some more info on the gui
	  part of genius.

Tue Oct 23 17:14:25 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: positive and nonnegative matrixes obviously can't
	  have complex entries so return false

Tue Oct 23 16:23:53 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: add IsMatrixPositive and IsMatrixNonnegative

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: add docs for the above

Tue Oct 23 16:04:56 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: add "version" function for checking the version

Tue Oct 23 15:42:03 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, src/funclibhelper.cP: Add IsZero and IsIdentity for
	  checking if a matrix is zeros or an identity

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: add docs for the above

Tue Oct 23 13:57:03 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: on errors don't print the whole filename for
	  opened files, just the displayed name

	* src/gnome-genius.c: add Ctrl->R for "Run"

Tue Oct 23 13:33:42 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel: slightly optimize
	  PivotColumns by removing unnecessary separators

	* src/matop.c, src/funclib.c: when computing det be smart about
	  matrices in rref form.  This way once we make a matrix rref,
	  we can use det to check if it is singular very quickly.  Also
	  set the rref flag on identity matrices.

Tue Oct 23 12:28:56 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: add "save all unsaved" menu item, fix the save
	  as dialog, and add confirmation on closing unsaved things.

Tue Oct 23 11:33:56 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/functions/numerical.gel: remove IsGaussianInteger, we already
	  have IsGaussInteger alias IsComplexInteger

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: updates and fixes

Tue Oct 23 10:51:24 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: better logic for figuring out something is a
	  URI

Mon Oct 22 21:39:42 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: recognize uris on the command line
	  and handle them correctly

Mon Oct 22 19:38:03 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: whack the old gtk file selection stuff,
	  I'm tired of fixing bugs in two versions of code.  Consistently
	  have uri's around as program->name internally.  Fix opening
	  files without specifying full path on command line.

	* configure.in: require at least gtk+ 2.3.5

Tue Oct 16 11:05:32 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.desktop.in: hmmm, Calculator;Utility; also fits
	  the bill.  Makes the menu entry appear twice at least in ubuntu.
	  ... hmmm oh well.  The default menu setup in gnome must be a little
	  braindead and uses too simple queries.

	* help/C/genius.xml: added Accessories to list of possible submenus

Tue Oct 16 10:53:33 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.desktop.in: change Office to Education as per
	  the vfolder spec (that's still somewhat wrong, but unfortunately
	  it is as close to standard behaviour as we get).  Also notice
	  that the Scientific category was wrong.  "Science" is correct
	  as per spec.

	* help/C/genius.xml: update the manual for where to find the icon.

Sun Oct 14 10:10:11 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: add Adrian E. Feiguin to the authors
	  list in the about box

Sun Oct 14 09:40:59 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: I finally found the culprit behind some of
	  the initial GEL implementations of standard library so I added
	  him, Nils Barth to the authors list.

Sun Oct 14 02:33:43 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/*: update the documentation a bit more.  Make it almost one
	file only by inlining all the things done as separate entities
	before, that was a nightmare to edit.  Only the function list
	and the legal nonsense is left separate.

Sat Oct 13 10:38:49 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/*.xml: minor fixes

Sat Oct 13 09:42:33 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.7.7

Wed Jan 31 23:01:00 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: use HUGE_VAL instead of 0.0 when we get an error,
	  this is better in that it doesn't display anything rather then 0

Mon Jan 29 18:49:07 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: do what we do on inside program runs, when

	  help/C/genius.xml: update for the above

	* help/C/Makefile.am: add gel-matrix-linalg.xml

Mon Jan 29 13:52:33 2007  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: don't set output style to normal before showing
	  full answer, we want it in the current style

	* configure.in: raise version

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests for new functions

Wed Aug 09 12:40:28 2006  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

Tue Aug 08 11:00:19 2006  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c, src/eval.c, src/funclib.c, src/matop.c:  Fix many
	  complex number comparisons to fix computation of complex matrix
	  determinants and other instances where gaussian elimination was
	  used.  Also for the polynomial functions and handling of booleans
	  and a few more.

	* src/genius.c: Add --exec option, follow gnu semantics for
	  the long options with arguments

	* src/geniustest.pl: Use --exec option instead of echo

	* src/geniustests.txt: Add tests for the complex number handling
	  fixes

Tue Aug 01 19:48:10 2006  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.7.5

Tue Aug 01 19:48:10 2006  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: use same geometry setup as gnome-terminal
	  (resize in terms of the terminal characters) I don't have
	  time to debug vte and new versions crap out when we don't set
	  this up.

	* po/POTFILES.in, Makefile.am, mpfr/Makefile.am,
	  mpfr/tests/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, help/C/Makefile.am:

	  gnome-common to fix distcheck

Tue Jul 18 20:35:23 2006  George (Jiri) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: fix matrix expanding

Mon Jul 17 01:55:30 2006  George (Jiri) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/*.gel: Added QRDecomposition, SesquilinearForm,
	  SesquilinearFormFunction, killed GramSchmidtDot, DotProduct is now
	  the actual dot product, not the hermitian product.  InnerProduct
	  now calls HermitianProduct not DotProduct.  GramSchmidt,
	  Projection, VectorAngle have the inner product as an optional
	  argument.  GramSchmidt normalizes the vectors.  NullSpace optimized
	  a bit, now no longer calls ColumnSpace which was not needed.  Fixed
	  OuterProduct to actually return the outer product not just the 1,1
	  element.  Killed HermitianProduct which moved to being C based

	* src/funclib.c, src/funclibhelper.cP: implemented HermitianProduct
	  in C, optimized StripZeroColumns in the case when there are no
	  columns to strip

	* src/matrixw.[ch], src/funclib.c: remember that we did rref so that
	  we don't do it several times (speeds up NullSpace a bit)

	* combinatorics/factorial.gel, lib/linear_algebra/*.gel,
	  statistics/basic.gel: use zeros instead of SetMatrixSize

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: update

Fri Jul 14 18:00:39 2006  George (Jiri) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, mpfr/*: update mpfr to 2.2.0 and require 2.2.0 in
	  the configure script

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/funclib.c: use mpfr_pow_z and whack our own
	  stupid version.  Add CatalanConstant and atan2 functions

	* help/C/gel-functions-list.xml, lib/functions/elementary.gel:
	  document CatalanConstant, atan2, and change all "reverse function"
	  to "inverse function".

Fri Jul 14 01:00:03 2006  George (Jiri) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c:  Add NextCombination function

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: add docs for NextCombination

Thu Jul 13 17:50:28 2006  George (Jiri) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, autogen.sh, acconfig.h, src/Makefile.am: use automake
	  1.9 to fix the po directory mess and other things.

	* mpfr/*: apparently automake gets update in cvs for this

Thu Jul 13 13:42:25 2006  George (Jiri) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.h, src/*.c: update copyright strings for 2006

Thu Jul 13 13:33:12 2006  George (Jiri) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/subspaces.gel:
	  Add CountZeroColumns function which is quicker then
	  stripping zero columns and then counting the remainder.  
	  Further port StripZeroColumns to C to make it a lot more
	  efficient.  This also optimizes things such as nullity, rank,
	  ColumnSpace, NullSpace and related.

	* src/geniustests.txt: Add some tests

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml, help/C/genius.xml: Update the manual,
	  and expand a bunch of entries for a bunch of functions.

Thu Jul 13 10:53:54 2006  George (Jiri) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/sets/basic.gel, src/funclib.c, src/eval.[ch]: Implement IsIn,
	  Intersection and SetMinus in C for speed

	* lib/linear_algebra/subspaces.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel:  Minor speed improvements
	  to NullSpace

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some more tests

	  leaks and memory corruption problems especially with respect to
	  loops and matrixes.

	* src/eval.c: fix evaluation of matrix entries to be a little faster
	  perhaps (don't ever push value nodes) and evaluate matrix entries
	  in the most obvious order rather then our previous
	  very weird order.

	* src/geniustest.txt: add a test

Wed Jul 12 14:26:35 2006  George (Jiri) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  slightly cut down vicious-extensions to make things work

2006-04-17  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Remove obsolete entry for no_NO.
	* po/no.po: And the translation.

2005-12-06  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

2005-08-24  Pawan Chitrakar  <pchitrakar@gmail.com>

	* configure.in: Added ne in ALL_LINGUAS

Thu Aug 11 11:51:10 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: make the unsaved work quit dialog work for
	  window closing as well (it just asked but quit anyway in that case).

2005-08-08  Chao-Hsiung Liao  <j_h_liau@yahoo.com.tw>

	* configure.in: Added "zh_TW" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Fri Jul 22 10:12:09 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  LinePlotCParametric

Fri Jun 24 17:39:48 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/symbolic.c, src/geniustests.txt: allow differentiation of
	  E_CALL's where first arg is a function, not an identifier, for
	  example this is what we get on SymbolicDerivative(sin*cos)

Fri Jun 24 17:21:22 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/symbolic.c, src/eval.c, src/geniustests.txt: Some more
	  simplification special casing, doing several tan derivatives is
	  now much faster and results in shorter answers, yay.  Also run
	  the evalnode hook so that we can interrupt a symbolic derivation
	  which is taking too long.

Fri Jun 24 16:23:01 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/longtest.gel: add many derivative tests

	* src/funclib.c: add IsFunctionOrIdentifier

	* lib/calculus/differentiation.gel: accept identifiers for all
	  functions and not just functions

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: add IsFunctionOrIdentifier

	* src/eval.c: Allow identifier + string to make a string

	* src/symbolic.c: fix some derivative definitions

	* src/eval.c: fixup nargs when creating new operator nodes in
	  simplification

Fri Jun 24 15:42:09 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: add symbolic equality (respects types)

	* src/eval.[ch]: further simplification of multiplication and
	  addition, still crap, but lesser crap now.  I need to make this
	  more general and nicer.

Wed Jun 22 13:19:39 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.[ch], src/symbolic.c: Add more aggressive "simplification"
	  and use it on the result of derivation (for example multiplication
	  by 1 or addition of 0 and such are now whacked)

Fri Jun 17 09:56:34 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: fix precedence of .+ and .- and also move 'call' in
	  precedence further to the top to bind more closely then =
	  make things like "x = f call (x)" work as you would expect.

	* lib/misc/misc.gel: add ComposePower

	* help/C/gel-functions-list.xml: add ComposePower docs

	* src/eval.c: in try_to_do_precalc, whack all double negations

	* src/symbolic.c: fix derivation of divisions, and make ln have
	  derivative of "x^-1" rather then "1/x" as we can take multiple
	  derivatives better there since we have no real simplification

Thu Jun 16 18:14:39 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/symbolic/differentiation.gel:  Add SymbolicNthDerivative,
	  SymbolicNthDerivativeTry, SymbolicTaylorApproximationFunction

	* configure.in, help/C/gel-function-list.xml, help/C/genius.xml:
	  Document the above

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests

Thu Jun 16 17:40:29 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version number

	* src/complil.c: compile symbolic_id and id for function nodes and
	  symbolic_id for global functions.

	* src/lexer.l, src/calc.c, src/eval.[ch], src/parse.y: SYNTAX CHANGE:
	  there is now an elt by elt addition and subtraction (.+ and .-)
	  which act like the old +,- when adding scalar to a matrix.  The +,-
	  now interpret A+x as A+x*I if A is a square matrix, and elt by elt
	  if A is a vector (row or column), else they error out.

	* src/funclib.c: the PolyToFunction now does 1 instead of x^0, since
	  this now works correctly for matrices.

	* src/lexer.l, src/calc.c, src/parse.y: make evalstack into
	  gel_parsestack since the naming was totally off

	* src/dict.h: on decompilation errors don't assert crash, just give
	  null as the function body.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests and fix some old ones with
	  respect to the above syntax change.

Wed Jun 15 09:09:20 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/symbolic.c, src/calc.[ch], src/dict.c, src/eval.c,
	  src/structs.h:  Fixup symbolic derivation to work inside functions,
	  preserve a "symbolic id" for the symbolic derivation when setting
	  variables to functions.  Also add SymbolicDerivativeTry function
	  to try symbolic derivative quietly.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests

	* lib/calculus/differentiation.gel: Add Derivative function which
	  tries symbolic first and numerical as a backup

	* help/C/gelfunction-list.xml: add SymbolicDerivativeTry and
	  Derivative

Tue Jun 14 10:23:51 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/symbolic.[ch], src/eval.[ch]: Add a primitive
	  SymbolicDerivative function.  Doesn't yet even get even all the
	  simple cases (such as functions with more then one argument) but
	  should be semi usable for simple things.  Of course there is no
	  simplification of expressions in genius so things can get wild a
	  bit.

	* src/graphing.c, src/funclib.c: adjustments because of the above

	* src/calc.c: remove an extra parenthesis in function printing
	  output.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests for SymbolicDerivative

	* help/C/gel-function-list.xml: Add SymbolicDerivative blurb

2005-04-01  Steve Murphy  <murf@e-tools.com>

	  implementation of zeta and gamma functions, must do this properly
	  at some point

Mon Mar 21 15:42:06 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: some allocation fixes, the float formatting is
	  incredibly evil!

Mon Mar 21 14:48:28 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: set default precision to 128
	  bits, it's faster and most people don't need more.  Also save the
	  precision in config.  Further sanitize things from the command line
	  and the config, to avoid using bogus values.

Mon Mar 21 11:18:57 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: move the whole gmp structures into the MpwRealNum
	  struct to avoid another pointer.  Further avoid initializing a new
	  number just to throw it away if possible and be smarter with
	  initialization types.  Fix some leaks and errors.

Fri Mar 18 18:03:30 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.ch: fixup memory usage by whacking the duplicate
	  pointers in the real number structure.

	* src/eval.c: fix leaks on elt by elt matrix operations

Fri Mar 18 11:48:14 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: whack the unneeded type field from mpw_t to save
	  a byte per number and probably make alignment nicer and all that.

Fri Mar 18 11:11:07 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c, src/funclib.[ch]: Allow drawing longer lines with
	  LinePlotDrawLine by passing in a matrix of points.

	  are subject to change of course

Tue Jan 04 10:57:18 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: use an existing mpfr function to check for the
	  library, DUH!

	* src/genius.c: include term.h AFTER everything since that happens to
	  redefine the word 'tab' for its own very evil purposes on some
	  systems (some ncurses version or some such)

Thu Dec 23 11:03:27 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/mpwrap.[ch]:
	  remove all non-mpfr stuff since we always have mpfr now which
	  removes quite a bit of ugliness.  Plus remove some other
	  cruft as well.

Tue Sep 14 17:14:53 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, lib/number_theory/misc.gel: make Divides built-in
	  which should make a number of things faster.  Also add
	  ExactDivision function using gmp's divexact which does exact
	  division much faster once we know that the two numbers actually
	  divide one another (it returns garbage otherwise).

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests

Tue Sep 14 16:31:51 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: Use ApplyOverMatrix(2) on a few
	  functions, and add BernoulliNumber

	* src/geniustests.txt: Add test for BernoulliNumber

Tue Sep 14 09:57:15 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: some cleanup, and set the extra optimization flags
	  directly rather then use -O3 since then -O2 would just reset thing,
	  so we again optimize nicely.

	* src/calc.[ch], src/funclib.c, src/genius.c, src/graphing.c:
	  Implement translation of help texts coming from the standard
	  library.  Still error texts are not translated, will need to
	  figure that out.  User generated help strings are gotten with
	  "genius --gettext" similarly to the "--compile" option.

	* Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.am, po/POTFILES.in: create and use
	  lib/library-strings.c

	* lib/equation_solving/find_root.gel: Move FIXME's from help text
	  to comment

	* src/genius.c: add --version option

	* gtkextra/gdmpsfont.c: fix memleak

Thu Aug 26 09:26:43 2004  Takeshi AIHANA <aihana@gnome.gr.jp>

	* configure.in: Added 'ja' (Japanese) to ALL_LINGUAS.

Fri Aug 20 10:57:58 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.spec.in, pixmaps/48x48/Makefile.am: install 48x48 icon in
	  the proper place

Fri Aug 20 10:35:25 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, src/gnome-genius.desktop.in,
	  pixmaps/*: Added an icon Eugenia Loli-Queru (eloli@hotmail.com)

Thu Aug 19 16:38:14 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.7.1

Thu Aug 19 16:15:32 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/calculus/differentiation.gel, lib/calculus/limits.gel:
	  Optimize and clean up the limitting/differentiating functions
	  a bit, and add NumericalLeftDerivative and NumericalRightDerivative

	* lib/misc/misc.gel, src/funclib.c, src/eval.[ch]: Make Identity
	  built-in for speed.  Also allow for stealing out of the parameter
	  list and use this technique in some places to further increased
	  speed (though this is a very small gain as numbers/matrices are
	  already copy-on-write, so we just avoid copying some structures)

	* src/mpwrap.c: fix mpw_uncomplex and allow setting without resorting
	  to mpw_uncomplex

	* lib/equation_solving/find_root.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel,
	  lib/number_theory/primes.gel, lib/calculus/integration.gel,
	  lib/calculus/integration.gel, lib/combinatorics/factorial.gel,
	  lib/combinatorics/recursive_sequences.gel,
	  lib/equation_solving/find_root.gel,
	  lib/functions/complex_numbers.gel, lib/functions/delta.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/bilinear_forms.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel, lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel,
	  lib/number_theory/modulus.gel, lib/number_theory/primes.gel,
	  lib/sets/basic.gel: tiny bit of optimizations and gel style cleanup 

	* lib/calculus/sums_products.gel: Fix InfiniteProduct2, change
	  behaviour of InfiniteSum/Product(2) no longer takes tolerance
	  argument but has similar parameters like the limiting operations
	  with SumProductTolerance, SumProductSFS, SumProductNumberOfTries

	* src/geniustests.txt: add more tests

Thu Aug 19 12:02:28 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: be even nicer in mem debug friendly mode and some
	  cleanup

	* src/mpwrap.c: a bit of cleanup

	* lib/calculus/differentiation.gel, lib/calculus/limits.gel,
	  lib/combinatorics/recursive_sequences.gel:  Fixup limit/derivative
	  functions.  Use better name NumericalDerivative instead of
	  NDerivative (but keep that as an alias) and add help strings to
	  everything (yay 100% of library functions have the simple help
	  strings now)

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests for the
	  NDerivative/IsContinuous/IsDifferentiable functions.  Also update
	  tests for the change in parenthesis printing

Fri Aug 13 10:13:46 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: fix crash of LinePlot() when no arguments are
	  passed by requiring at least one argument (same for SurfacePlot)

Thu Aug 12 18:15:20 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.spec.in: applied patch from Florin Andrei <florin@andrei.myip.org>
	  to export custom compiler flags to the build and to require vte-devel for the build

	* configure.in: add -O3 in front of CFLAGS not after to allow custom
	  CFLAGS to override this

	* gtkextra/gtkplot3d.h: fix prototype, thanks to Erik Sigra
          <sigra@home.se> for noticing

Thu Aug 12 10:48:59 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: run EPS output through ps2epsi if found which adds
	  a bitmap preview.  The preview kind of sucks but it's better then
	  nothing.  Fix EPS/PS export for gtk older then 2.4.  Add PNG
	  export.

	* src/graphing.c, src/calc.c: remove some parenthesis from output
	  where it doesn't make sense (still some places are overzelaous).
	  Also when graphing from a dialog take the entered string as the
	  function string to display in the plot.  Makes things even nicer.

	* src/gnome-genius.c: change the "translator_credits-..." to
	  "translator-credits" which is apparently more translation
	  software friendly as it doesn't contain underscores.  Plus a hack
	  to get the old translation to not lose credits

Tue Aug 10 17:30:32 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.7.0

	* genius.spec.in: fixed up for the update-mime-database stuff

Fri Aug 06 17:41:47 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: change some labels to make more sense.  On top view
	  hide z axis temporarily.  Swap X and Y and rotate a bit to get that
	  mirror effect fixed.

Fri Aug 06 11:59:39 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: simple rotations of the 3d plot and add labels to
	  axis.  It still bugs me that the X axis is reversed from what
	  I would normally want (right to left rather then left to right,
	  it's a mirror image so it's impossible to fix just by rotation),
	  oh well.

Thu Aug 05 15:39:17 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/gtkplot.c: replace sprintf with g_snprintf

Thu Aug 05 02:14:15 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: when plotting surfaces, the expression may return
	  something which has different number of arguments, so allow
	  rerunning the function if this happens

Thu Aug 05 01:28:43 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/Makefile.am: fix building by adding all the needed
	  include dirs

Thu Aug 05 01:21:03 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: wrap both long description labels on the create
	  plot dialog and align them left.  Add mnemonics to the notebook
	  tabs

Thu Aug 05 00:52:15 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: sin, cos, sinh, cosh were wrong for complex arguments

Wed Aug 04 23:07:46 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: make window titles saner

Wed Aug 04 22:33:46 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.[ch], src/graphing.c: some cleanup on the line
	  plotting stuff, don't draw outside the box, etc...

	* src/graphing.c, src/mpwrap.[ch]: Add surface plotting, only one
	  function at a time and can take one or two arguments (complex
	  number or x and y).  Added both a dialog entry method and a
	  SurfacePlot function

	* configure.in: now it merits to raise version to 0.7.0

Wed Aug 04 17:27:08 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gnome-genius.[ch], gui/graphing.c: implement the printing
	  and ps/eps export at least in a rudimentary way.

	* gui/gnome-genius.[ch]: fix the "file exists" dialogs, they were
	  reversed on save, and on load the "can't open" dialog was wrong.

Wed Aug 04 17:27:06 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtkextra/*, configure.in: import some files from gtkextra-2 for the
	  GtkPlot* and friends

	* src/gnome-genius.[ch], src/graphing.c: whack the old graphing
	  nonsense and use gtkextra gtkplot.  Right now it has no added
	  functionality over the old plotting, but it looks different.
	  However we will have PS/EPS export and printing pretty easily
	  now and further we can now easily also add parametric and surface
	  plots and flows and such.

Thu Jul 29 09:55:10 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.[ch]: Allocate all memory for GelETree's, and the
	  various loop structures in long continuous spaces with the
	  structures aligned properly.  This seems to have little
	  impact on speed but it has some impact on memory usage, about
	  20% in a test that uses deep recursion.  As a side effect the
	  free lists are no longer purged.  Also fix the MEM_DEBUG_FRIENDLY
	  mode to actually free memory unless the MEM_DEBUG_SUPER_FRIENDLY
	  is on.

	* configure.in: automatically turn on -O3 for gcc, this seems
	  to make a very minor dent in performance.  -fomit-frame-pointer
	  does better, but we really don't want no debugging on this code.

Wed Jul 28 18:26:49 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: add longtest.gel to EXTRA_DIST

	* src/calc.[ch]: change the way that gel_runexp behaves
	  to avoid extra copying of whole expressions all the time.
	  it now eats the expression and thus is consistent with
	  the other calls such as gel_evalexp_parsed.

	* src/parseutils.c, src/eval.[ch]: plug a small leak
	  on boolean conversion

	* src/eval.[ch]: Add whole bunch of debugging functionality
	  especially for debugging memory.  Keep list of new trees
	  in between expressions to test for memory leaks when
	  EVAL_DEBUG is defined and we are MEM_DEBUG_FRIENDLY

	* src/eval.c: fix leak in the if operation when the main
	  tree was WHACKARGed and we'd forget that

Wed Jul 28 16:09:23 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.desktop.in: Move Name/Comment to the end to allow
	  quicker (perhaps) parsing, add Mime-Type key.

	* lib/statistics/basic.gel: fix StandardDeviation

	* eval.c: fix nargs problem when making binary operation functions

	* calc.c, eval.[ch], genius.c, gnome-genius.c, parse.y, parseutil.[ch],
	  structs.h:  Fix pushing multiple operator arguments onto the stack
	  in the correct order.  Compact all the separator operations into
	  one with many arguments during parsing, this saves copying.  Add a
	  GE_WHACKARG flag to the stack flags and whack the node after use,
	  this saves some memory which got wasted by keeping things in memory
	  because of the separator compactification.  Also make the memory
	  operations much nicer when MEM_DEBUG_FRIENDLY is defined.

	* src/mpwrap.c: work around a mpfr problem where random values from
	  mpf_urandomb can be negative sometimes.  Also cache the random
	  state to avoid reiniting/reseeding it all the time.

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/longtest.gel: add a long test file

Thu Jul 15 16:44:40 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c, src/compil.c, src/dict.c, src/eval.[ch], src/funclib.c,
	  src/graphing.c, src/matop.[ch], src/matrixw.[ch], src/mpwrap.[ch],
	  src/parse.y, src/parseutil.[ch], src/plugin.c, src/structs.h,
	  src/util.[ch]:  Add native boolean types.  Make all boolean
	  expressions return these, add the true and false functions and
	  aliases, add IntegerFromBoolean and IsBoolean functions

	* lib/functions/delta.gel, lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel,
	  lib/misc/misc.gel, lib/number_theory/misc.gel,
	  lib/number_theory/modulus.gel, lib/number_theory/primes.gel:
	  Update for the boolean types, use where appropriate whack the
	  old true/false functions.

	* src/geniustests.txt: update tests to expect booleans where
	  appropriate

	* doc/manual.txt: updates for the booleans and some other cleanups
	  and updates

	* configure.in: raise version since the compiled format changed.

Mon Jun 14 10:27:59 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.6.1

	* genius.spec.in: fix

Mon Jun 14 10:20:26 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: do the nice fraction printing for mixed fractions

	* src/mpwrap.c: minor cleanup

Fri Jun 11 18:06:54 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/dict.[ch], src/eval.c: add suggestion logic on undefined
	  identifiers, a little screwy code, but somewhat works.

	* src/calc.c: when we don't do mixed fractions try to be nice about
	  printing larger fractions.  Kind of on crack, we should do it
	  in more cases.

Fri May 28 10:02:19 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: The default font size for the console
	  is now deduced from the window for size.  Also unless the
	  font is actually set, the change is not written to preferences.
	  The console is set to UTF-8 always since we always feed it utf-8
	  strings which fixes non-utf-8 locales.  Plus a small amount of
	  cleanup.

Thu May 27 16:11:07 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.xml, Makefile.am: add genius to the shared mime info db

Thu May 27 15:39:48 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius-readline-helper.c, src/gnome-genius.[ch]:  Add
	  Black on white mode for those that don't see white on black too
	  well.  Start using vfs, but we still don't use it for "loading",
	  nor do we setup the filechooser or whatnot, must figure out how to
	  do that.  Accept file drops on the window and open those files.

	* Makefile.am, genius.keys, genius.mime: temporary placeholders, need
	  to add this to the shared mime info stuff or whatnot.

Wed Apr 21 21:18:00 2004  Evandro Fernandes Giovanini  <evandrofg@ig.com.br>

	* configure.in(ALL_LINGUAS): Added "pt_BR" (Brazilian Portuguese).

Thu Apr 15 20:43:00 2004  Adam Weinberger <adamw@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added en_CA to ALL_LINGUAS.

Thu Apr 15 14:19:40 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/combinatorics/factorial.gel, lib/combinatorics/misc.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel,
	  lib/number_theory/factoring.gel, lib/number_theory/modulus.gel,
	  lib/number_theory/primes.gel,
	  src/calc.c, src/eval.c, src/funclib.c, src/gnome-genius.c,
	  src/matrixw.c, src/mpzextra.c: fix some typos in strings.  Mostly
	  s/then/than/.

Tue Apr 13 11:17:34 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: move the plot dialog buttons to be in HIGgy order

Fri Apr 09 18:34:58 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* INSTALL.MacOSX: Mac OS X install instructions from Linc Davis
	  <ld-temp-spe8@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: Changed help for --enable-gnome and
	  --enable-gtksourceview (changed to --disable-* since they're
	  on by default)

Tue Apr 06 15:41:18 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/util.[ch], src/mpwrap.c: whack the custom mem-allocation cruft
	  and let gmp use its own allocation.  Doesn't seem to improve speed
	  by much at all, but reduces cruft.

Sun Apr 04 22:30:12 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/geniustests.txt: added some tests that went wrong at some
	  point long time ago

Sun Apr 04 17:39:55 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/functions/complex_numbers.gel: add cis function.  Also fix
	  the MoebiusMapping* definitions

	* lib/functions/Makefile.am: forgot to include complex_numbers.gel
	  in the library DOH! this actually adds all those functions promised
	  in 0.6.0.  Affects: Argument, arg, Arg, MoebiusDiskMapping,
	  MoebiusMapping, MoebiusMappingInftyToOne, MoebiusMappingInftyToZero,
	  MoebiusMappingInftyToInfty.

Sun Apr 04 17:27:33 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: when parsing errors occur print them before saying
	  we couldn't parse anything.

Sun Apr 04 17:19:08 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: when 'i' is used uninitialized then suggest using '1i'
	  instead

Sun Apr 04 16:35:38 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: Make the console version be
	  translated though there are still utf-8 issues.  Also the welcome
	  string is now slightly different since gettext seemed to have a fit
	  with the escapes and all that.

Sun Apr 04 15:52:00 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.[ch], eval.c, src/funclib.c, src/graphing.c, src/matop.c,
	  src/mpwrap.[ch], src/plugin.c:  Cleanup and update the copyright
	  strings, add "gel_" to the print_etree functions.

	* src/eval.c: fix "number <=> string" which was returning completely
	  wrong answers

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests for comparison

2004-04-03  Gareth Owen  <gowen72@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in: Added en_GB to ALL_LINGUAS

Tue Mar 30 15:08:05 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.6.0

	* src/mpwrap.c: define G_MAXINT32 if not defined to allow compilation
	  with older glib

Tue Mar 30 14:56:27 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: further optimization of the mp* free lists gets some
	  improvement mainly for floats.  Plus fix the mpf free list when
	  changing precision.

Tue Mar 30 11:36:13 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: remove the NATIVEINT type and use mpz which is
	  slightly slower, however cache inited mpz/mpq/mpf(r) types which 
	  makes the code actually run a LOT faster then with NATIVEINT, at
	  least for the testcases I considered.  This also reduces code
	  complexity by quite a bit (removed 600+ loc) and furthermore
	  optimizes both mpq/mpf performance too.  Also some minor cleanup
	  and leak fixes.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some more random tests that popped up
	  during testing of the above

Tue Mar 30 09:52:39 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/functions/Makefile.am, lib/functions/kernels.gel:
	  Add PoissonKernel, DirichletKernel and FejerKernel

	* lib/functions/complex_numbers.gel: Add MoebiusDiskMapping,
	  MoebiusMapping, MoebiusMappingInftyToOne, MoebiusMappingInftyToZero
	  and MoebiusMappingInftyToInfty

	* src/calc.c, src/genius.c: fix compilation of parameters, avoid
	  compilation of built in parameters plus minor cleanup

2003-03-28  Kostas Papadimas  <pkst@gnome.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added "el" (Greek).

Thu Mar 25 16:52:47 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am:  Allow compilation without GNOME

	* src/util.h: fixup headers 

	* doc/manual.txt: minor fixes/additions

	* README, NEWS: update

Thu Mar 25 10:05:57 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, src/*.[ch]: don't link the 'genius' binary with
	  any gui libs, still the configure/build process requires gnome
	  always, but I'm working on that.   Fix up the includes and
	  add a genius-i18n.h header

	* src/graphing.c, src/mpwrap.c, src/funclib.c: use the G_MAX/MIN
	  macros instead of limits.h for I suppose better portability

	* src/genius.c: use g_print* variants instead of printf and fprintf

Wed Mar 24 17:10:55 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: fix printing of functions

Wed Mar 24 16:39:18 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.[ch], src/calc.c: Add basic arithmethic operations on
	  functions, for example sin^2 will make a new function that
	  does sin(x)^2, so you can do say "LinePlot(sin^2)", or
	  more uselessly "sin^2 call (x)" 

	* src/geniustests.txt: update the tests a bit

	* src/funclib.c, src/eval.[ch]: Add "function return" to some 
	  1 value functions such as exp, so that e.g. exp(sin) returns
	  a function that does exp(sin(x)).  Currently supported are:
	  conj, sin, cos, sinh, cosh, tan, atan, sqrt, exp, ln, log2, log10,
	  round, floor, ceil, trunc, float, Numerator, Denominator, Re and
	  Im.

	* src/graphing.c: Fix LinePlot function (we messed up the replot
	  data), also if the function returns functions, then evaluate those
	  instead (don't recurse further though)

Wed Mar 24 11:04:26 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/manual.txt, lib/linear_algebra/*.gel: fixup some documentation

	* lib/**/Makefile.am: fix installation of loader.gel into the
	  correct directory (not into /bin/ whoops :)

Tue Mar 23 15:21:12 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l, src/parse.y, src/eval.[ch], src/calc.c:  Add
	  := (E_DEFEQUALS) operator which is never translated to ==.
	  Also use E_DEFEQUALS on function definitions always so that
	  they don't get translated (that would just be plain
	  confusing).

	* src/geniustests.txt: add tests for :=

	* doc/manual.txt: update for the := operator

Tue Mar 23 14:35:09 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/gnome-genius.[ch], src/calc.c, src/eval.c:
	  Cleanup, print version in title, make titles more sane + 
	  some string changes, a bit of renaming, add gnome-genius.h header
	  to export the current setup and update some copyright notices

	* src/graphing.c: fixup wrt the header, add status icons next to
	  the entries, make enter do the plot, add "Fit Y axis" function
	  to the plot window, errors that occur when we invoke the engine
	  from the graph window now always go to dialogs, And fix graphing
	  the identity (that is, just "x")

Tue Mar 23 11:14:02 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/graphing.[ch]:  Add a plot dialog where it
	  is easier to enter functions to plot and specify range and add
	  menu items and toolbar item for this.

	* src/graphing.c: Handle errors better when calling a function
	  instead of just treating them as 0.  Also fixup errors from the
	  LinePlot function to not affect the replot data until we
	  are successful in collecting new data.

	* src/dict.[ch]: minor cleanup

Mon Mar 22 13:23:46 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: add scale to graphs, allow zooming in and zooming
	  out, fix a bunch of issue wrt interruptions, window closing and
	  range specification.

Fri Mar 19 17:42:38 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: properly interrupt on Ctrl-C and also whack
	  the readbuf* which weren't used anymore

Fri Mar 19 16:52:18 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: use GtkFileChooser if compiled with a new
	  enough gtk+, but still allow compilation with GtkFileSelector
	  in case old gtk+ is used.  Also fix up some strings.  Finally
	  add .gel as the file extension on Save As.. if no extension
	  was used.

	* configure.in: fixup a bit

Fri Mar 19 11:11:01 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: apparently separator setting is just plain
	  ignored for message dialogs so don't set it (avoids unsightly
	  GTK+ warnings with new GTK+)

Fri Mar 19 11:05:00 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.[ch], src/calc.c: translate e^x to exp(x) since that is
	  more precise

	* src/mpwrap.c: better error reporting for inverses, better random
	  number seeding, fix of mpw_randint function if rop==op, and minor
	  general cleanup

	* configure.in: raise version

Wed Mar 10 21:22:00 2004 Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@computer.org>

	* configure.in: Added ga to ALL_LINGUAS (Irish).

Tue Jan 20 15:56:30 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/special_matrices.gel: add rotation matrices

Wed Dec 31 14:41:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.7.1

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix spinners being too thin

Wed Dec 31 12:04:56 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.7

Wed Dec 31 11:40:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: mpwfr_pow is kind of broken in gmp 4.1.2 at least
	  (seems fixed in newer mpfr, will have to do some sort of a check
	  in the future).

	* lib/functions/elementary.gel: add ErrorFunction/erf

	* lib/functions/sums_products.gel: add InfiniteProduct and
	  InfiniteProduct2

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests

	* Makefile.am: add intltool-modules/XML/Parser/Style/OrigTree.pm
	  to EXTRA_DIST

	* configure.in: raise version, whack the DEPRECATED things

Fri Dec 12 10:31:55 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/subspaces.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel:  Fix Kernel([0]) (it gave
	  correct answer, but also gave errors) and do some cleanup
	  as well

Wed Oct 29 16:59:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: allow very very very large powers of 1,-1,1i and -1i.
	  also ui divisions should return an int if the denominator is 1

Tue Oct 28 10:15:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: be nicer in integer powers of pure imaginary
	  integers/rationals

Thu Oct 16 10:21:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.6

	* src/Makefile.am: fix build

2003-10-15  Jordi Mallach  <jordi@sindominio.net>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added "ca" (Catalan).

Tue Oct 07 15:08:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version

	* configure.in, src/calc.c, src/compil.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/gnome-genius.c, src/graphing.c:  Whack use of
	  all deprecated stuff.  Also make the graphing canvas
	  use monospace 10 and not 12

Tue Oct 07 10:04:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, src/plugin.c,
	  src/plugread.c, src/genius.c: Kill gnome dependency in
	  the command line genius by using ve-config and
	  vicious-extensions.  Only codewise though, it is still linked
	  to gnome.  Though that should not be too hard to fix and
	  non-gnome non-gui builds may again be possible.  Not to mention
	  that startup of non-gui code is faster meaning faster testing
	  and less other whacky code to screw up valgrind runs etc...

	* src/mpwrap.c: fix corruption with respect to extra types when
	  rop == op1 or op2 and reenable the no_convert extra type
	  optimization.  Also fixes a leak of gmp internal data on all
	  divisions and gcd and mod operations.

Mon Oct 06 18:02:07 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: revert the change (sort of) something is wrong,
	  and I don't have time to investigate

Mon Oct 06 17:47:26 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: during some operations we were unnecessairly
	  converting the rop only to wipe it, so add a no_convert version
	  of the extra type function (affected are division and mod in case
	  rop was of a different type)

Mon Oct 06 17:00:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/misc/misc.gel: add Identity function

	* lib/calculus/differentiation.gel, lib/calculus/limits.gel,
	  lib/functions/numerical.gel: Tolerances should be floats really

	* configure.in, lib/Makefile.am, lib/sets/Makefile.am,
	  lib/sets/basic.gel, lib/misc/misc.gel:  Move the set theoretic
	  functions from misc to new dir called 'sets'

	* lib/functions/numerical.gel: add aliases Sign and AbsoluteValue

	* src/calc.c, src/compil.c, src/dict.h, src/eval.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/graphing.c, src/matrixw.h, src/mpwrap.[ch], src/mpzextra.c,
	  src/structs.h:  Some minor cleanup all over the place, plus 
	  more reordering and other struct tricks to reduce footprint of
	  common structures even further.

2003-10-05  Danilo Šegan  <dsegan@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Added "sr" and "sr@Latn" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Fri Sep 26 18:46:32 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/structs.h, src/eval.c: shave 4 bytes off the GelETree (at least
	  on x86) The savings will be invisible on archs with alignment.  So
	  we're down at 20 bytes per GelETree node (plus any data of course)

2003-09-01  Metin Amiroff  <metin@karegen.com>

	configure.in: Added "az" in ALL_LINGUAS.

Sun Aug 31 23:27:00 2003  Wang Jian  <lark@linux.net.cn>

	* configure.in: Added "zh_CN" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Thu Aug 28 23:29:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.[ch], src/dict.[ch], src/eval.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/inter.c, src/lexer.l,
	  src/mpwrap.c, src/structs.h:  Can't sleep so doing general
	  cleanup such as using standard argument checking for functions,
	  fixing up error output, converting to gel_errorout/infoout,
	  and s/int/gboolean/ where appropriate.  Also fixed up the
	  function structure to save sizeof(int) bytes per function.

Thu Aug 28 17:51:35 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: move stuff to generalized function parameter
	  handling as possible.  Should make translations easier.  Also
	  accept identifiers in places where it makes sense to (SetHelp,
	  protect, and such) and add a bunch of G_UNLIKELY/G_LIKELY's

Wed Aug 27 18:06:05 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/dict.c: initialize the function structures correctly.

Thu Aug 21 12:21:16 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: also set the PRIMARY and not just CLIPBOARD on
	  the special copy items

Sat Aug 16 18:58:56 2003  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

	* configure.in: Added "hi" for Hindi in ALL_LINGUAS.

Fri Aug 15 02:39:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c, src/eval.c, src/calc.c: go wild with G_LIKELY
	  and G_UNLIKELY, some cleanup, fix two very minor leaks.

Mon Jul 28 10:35:26 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h: check for ncurses as well if libtermcap
	  isn't found

	* src/genius.c: use GETTEXT_PACKAGE and not PACKAGE

Thu Jul 24 17:24:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: I hate it when I apply half of a patch.  in any
	  case yet again from the FreeBSD ports: the glob usage was wrong

Thu Jul 24 17:22:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: when wordexp is missing and we use glob but
	  we weren't including glob.h  (from the FreeBSD ports)

Thu Jun 12 14:17:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: load programs from command line

Thu Jun 12 14:09:34 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, genius.lang, src/gnome-genius.c: add
	  optional GtkSourceView support and add highlighting with that.
	  I should figure out the mime type mess and install all this stuff
	  so that even gedit can get highlighting for gel files.

Wed Jun 11 11:27:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius-readline-helper.c, src/inter.c: change directory in the
	  readline helper, and update the helper completion routine to match
	  inter.c

Fri Jun 06 16:25:15 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: the preference dialog has hig ordered buttons
	  and all the other dialogs also now lack the separator thingie.

Mon Jun 02 13:32:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.5 

	* src/gnome-genius.c: when we go to the last error there was an
	  "off by one" error

Mon Jun 02 13:18:53 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/geniustests.txt: add test for sqrt with mod

	* src/gnome-genius.c: print line number in the statusbar, and on
	  error place the cursor at the point of the last error (kind of
	  a hack, should somehow mark all errors)

Mon Jun 02 10:13:13 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: fix resetting the modulo after recursive eval call
	  (was a crash)

	* src/funclib.c, src/calc.[ch]: a lot of messages are now unified
	  for ease of translation and argument checking is done with
	  helper routines.  Also when the sqrt is called with mod try calling
	  the SqrtModPrime or erroring out.

Sun Jun 01 09:14:06 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/modulus.gel: add
	  SilverPohligHellmanWithFactorization function which does the
	  discrete log but knowing the factorization of q-1, so if you do
	  a bunch of discrete logs this can be a lot faster.

Sat May 31 15:11:04 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/numbertheory/modulus.gel: add IsPrimitiveModWithPrimeFactors,
	  which is like IsPrimitiveMod, but we already put in the
	  prime factors of q-1, so this is faster if we are testing a whole
	  bunch of numbers or if we know factorization of q-1 beforehand.
	  Use this for the primitive element finding routines.
	  Also add SqrtModPrime which computes square roots modulo a prime.

	* src/gnome-genius.c: Fix saving and opening of files (DOH!) also
	  set the filename and the directory each time when openning the
	  fileselector so that you don't have to retype everything.

	* src/calc.c, src/funclib.c: rename an easter egg to prevent
	  name conflict

Fri May 30 17:13:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: print out errors/infos after program run.  DOH!

Wed May 28 16:57:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.4

	* src/gnome-genius.desktop.in: add Office category keyword

Wed May 28 16:37:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: implement save and save as (at least
	  somewhat sanely).  Cut/Copy/Paste are now implemented for
	  the program panes.  If we are leaving the program the 'are you
	  sure' message takes into account if there are any unsaved
	  progs.

Wed May 28 13:32:39 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: smarter dialog behaviour for open and load,
	  and add a reload menu item and also do some de-deprecation

Wed May 28 10:17:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: cleanup the program stuff a bit, add a programs
	  menu and make selected program stick even if you switch to console
	  to be able to run multiple times easily.

Tue May 27 17:47:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: implement open file, mark changed files
	  as changed, the toolbar has now open and not load and load label
	  changed to "Load and Run" to be clear

Tue May 27 16:59:54 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/lexer.[lh], src/calc.[chl, src/gnome-genius.c,
	  src/genius.c:  The my_yy_ functions are now gel_lexer_ functions
	  and lexer.l is installed.

	* src/gnome-genius.c: Implement tabs as programs using text view,
	  and allow running of these tabs as programs with output to main
	  console.  No openning/saving functionality yet.

Tue May 27 14:18:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/misc/misc.gel: add Compose function to compose two functions

Tue May 27 14:07:16 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/modulus.gel: add IndexCalculus,
	  IndexCalculusPrecalculation, FindPrimitiveElementMod and
	  FindRandomPrimitiveElementMod functions that I did for class
	  a while back.

Tue May 27 13:11:00 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: fix the gmp accessors

	* src/mpzextra.[ch], src/funclib.c, lib/number_theory/factoring.gel:
	  snarf the Pollard-Rho implementation from gmp examples and use it
	  for a built in version of Factorize, and whack the gel one and
	  also whack FactorizeLoopMax as it doesn't make sense now.  Also
	  add possibility to interrupt the primality tests (except when
	  inside mpz_millerrabin).

	* src/eval.c: if an interruption is raised during a built in
	  function call, then raise exception.

Wed May 21 16:42:05 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: the int power functions were stupid and weren't
	  working for greater then ulong powers anyway.  So for the floating
	  one convert to a float if the power is too big, for the integer
	  one just make an error, since the number would be too big to be
	  useful (as an integer of course)

Wed May 21 16:06:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: allow access to the low level gmp types

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel, src/mpzextra.[ch], src/mpwrap.[ch],
	  src/funclib.[ch], src/Makefile.am:
	  rework the prime testing stuff.  Use the mpz MillerRabin test,
	  and also snatch the strong pseudoprime test from gmp and make it
	  internal and whack StrongPseudoprimeSub.  MillerRabinTest now
	  takes the number of reps as an argument (an integer) and not an
	  epsilon!  IsPrime is rewritten internally as well for speed using
	  first mpz_probab_prime_p for the trial factoring, and then strong
	  pseudoprime tests for 2,3,5,7 and then some Miller-Rabin for good
	  measure.  Whack the IsPrimeLoopMax and PrimeProbabilityEpsilon
	  parameters and add IsPrimeMillerRabinReps parameter.  Whack the
	  IsPrimeProbability since it doesn't fit with the above and IsPrime
	  really does that.  MillerRabinTestSure is also now internal.

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/funclib.c: the EulerConstant is now taken
	  from MPFR if available instead of compiling in the long string
	  version and reading that each time.

	* src/funclib.c: a little bit of argument checking cleanup.

	* lib/functions/elementary.gel, src/mpwrap.c: Use MPFR for log10
	  and log2, or do some these functions internally with ln, also
	  add lg as an alias to log2

	* src/geniustests.txt: fix a wrong test (misread strong pseudoprime
	  and pseudoprime. 341 is the first pseudoprime to base 2,
	  not strong pseudoprime to base 2.  Also add some tests, and remove
	  tests for IsPrimeProbability.

Mon Apr 28 18:04:00 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: allow null for the set in the "for in" type loops to
	  just mean empty

	* lib/misc/misc.gel: Implement MakeSet, Union, Intersection and
	  document SetMinus and IsIn

	* src/funclib.c: add a "Set Theory" category for help

Mon Apr 28 17:33:37 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, src/eval.[ch], src/structs.h: implement the
	  no_mod_all_args flag.  Add flag setting function to the
	  standard lib.  Use the no_mod_all_args flag on builtin C
	  functions where it makes sense (I, zeros, ones, rand, randint)
	  Also implement the GetCurrentModulo() function to get the
	  modulo of the calling context.

	* lib/functions/elementary.gel: the log function only takes an
	  optional base argument and without it acts as ln.  Also we look at
	  the modulo of the calling context and call DiscreteLog in case
	  there is one so "log(13,6) mod 229" works as it should.

Fri Apr 25 16:41:13 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/compil.c, src/funclib.c, src/structs.h: allow mod propagation
	  into function, at least for built in ones and propagate into ref,
	  rref, and SolveLinearSystem

	* src/eval.[ch], src/matop.[ch]: attempt at mod awaring the gauss function
	  but it fails horribly unless we are in a finite field.

	* src/eval.c: fix a very small leak in loops and a very large leak in
	  evaluating and/or expressions

	* src/parse.y: mod now binds tighter then logical operators to make
	  things as "if a == b mod n and a == c mod n then ..." work properly
	  also call binds tighter then the logical operators then

	* src/calc.c: when function is undocumented, print at least a
	  prototype

	* src/matop.c: gauss correctly returns TRUE/FALSE even if stopsing
	  is FALSE

	* src/funclib.c: add SolveLinearSystem function that solves general
	  linear systems easily.  zeros and ones can now take only one
	  argument and that just gives a row vector.

Mon Apr 21 20:23:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: elements, rows, columns accept
	  null and treat it as 0x0 matrix

Wed Apr 16 11:14:32 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/compil.c: kill useless assert

	* lib/calculus/integration.gel: add NumericalIntegral which calls
	  some integral rule with steps as set by the parameters

Wed Apr 16 11:03:54 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/calculus/integration.gel: add MidpointRule to make quicker
	  calculations

Mon Apr 14 14:35:39 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: allow return after comma to break a long vector input

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: add ConvertToBase and ConvertFromBase

Mon Mar 24 22:07:33 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/modulus.gel: add reference for the
	  DiscreteLog algorithm, add IsPrimitiveMod function

Mon Mar 24 21:54:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel, lib/number_theory/modulus.gel,
	  src/geniustests.txt:  Implemented CRT (ChineseRemainder) and
	  DiscreteLog (Silver-Pohlig-Hellman for F_q where q a prime) 
	  for homework.  Should really be built in, but for now we have to
	  get by with this.

Mon Mar 24 15:04:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: mod matrices after primitives, and add a fixme,
	  most operations already do modding so this is not very efficent,
	  but at least it's correct for now.  Fixes for example
	  "-[1] mod 2"

Mon Mar 24 14:31:29 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/dict.c, src/eval.c: fix var substitution crash, and add
	  some memory debug friendliness

Mon Mar 10 13:10:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel, lib/number_theory/misc.gel:
	  add AreRelativelyPrime function and fix the IsStrongPseudoprime
	  function

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: add LeastAbsoluteResidue function

Mon Mar 10 11:49:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, src/eval.[ch], src/mpwrap.[ch]:  Add IsEven and
	  IsOdd using the native gmp functions for speed improvement.  Also
	  add StringToASCII, ASCIIToString, AlphabetToString and
	  StringToAlphabet functions to make doing some cryptography stuff
	  easier.

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: whack IsEven and IsOdd

Mon Mar 10 10:55:14 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: add MillerRabinTestSure, which
	  tests primes in O((log n)^5) time that is a deterministic
	  algorithm (given Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is true)

Mon Mar 10 10:44:40 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theorey/primes.gel: improve on the
	  Miller-Rabin test to optimize things a bit and add
	  IsStrongPseudoprimeSub which must already get
	  a and t where n-1 = 2^a * t, so that this doesn't have
	  to be computed over and over.

Wed Mar 05 14:14:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.3

Wed Mar 05 14:13:03 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c, src/parseutil.c: when expanding matrices treat nulls
	  as empty matrices to allow easy appending, prepending and all such
	  stuff.

	* src/calc.c: be anal on printing numbers with powers and factorials
	  so that the output is genius parsable

Sat Mar 01 10:03:32 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: on setting FloatPrecision actually break e and
	  GoldenRatio caches to recalculate (reread) these

Sat Mar 01 09:55:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: rational powers now use mpz_root to return an integer
	  if possible.

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: remove SymbolicNthRoot and do smarter
	  IsNthRoot given the new usage of powers

Fri Feb 28 13:32:46 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: play with graph colors, make graph lines 1.5 thick,
	  add a plot progress indicator

	* src/mpwrap.c: fix conversions to int and rational from float

	* doc/manual.txt: add a note about unitary minus

Fri Feb 28 11:55:15 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: raise precision back to 256
	  bits as mpfr is blazing fast on that as well.

Fri Feb 28 11:11:56 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], configure.in, src/Makefile.am:  If MPFR is present
	  use it for functions like sin, cos, atan, pow, log, exp.  This
	  increases speed of those operations by a LOT (simple test gave
	  about 10 times the speedup).  Still you can use genius without
	  mpfr, since it usually doesn't seem to be present in GMP packages
	  since packagers tend to not add --enable-mpfr (I don't know why
	  it's not the default).  In any case since mpfr is a static library
	  so far I think builds that I make on my system will work for people
	  with the standard GMP package from redhat.

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/genius.c: add a note in case MPFR isn't
	  compiled in to the copyright string so that people know if they
	  are running without it.

Thu Feb 27 18:07:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c, src/lexer.l, src/parse.y, src/eval.[ch], src/calc.c:
	  Make UMINUS bind less then factorials and powers and have factorials
	  bind tighter then powers but then fixup the tree to make things
	  like -1^k still come out as (-1)^k (but -a^k is -(a^k)).  One
	  of those WYMIWYG things.

	* src/graphing.c: fixup labels a bit

	* src/calc.c: when printing a power be specific about how to parse
	  any UMINUS

Thu Feb 27 16:56:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.[ch], src/eval.[ch]: Copy the token into functions
	  when we eval them to be able to identify them.  And label functions
	  on the graph by their token or their body if it is less then 64
	  characters long.  Also fix problems with too ofset plot window.
	  The default plotwindow is now a parameter called LinePlotWindow.

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: make default precision 128
	  since it will make things faster.  Currently <anything>^float
	  and exponentials and logs are utterly slow, even in lower
	  precision.

Thu Feb 27 10:17:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/graphing.c, src/inter.c: graph progressively
	  to show how far we got.  Fix a long standing bug with getting an
	  unusable prompt if interrupt is hit without anything running.

Thu Feb 27 09:55:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: make graph window a dialog, allow
	  stopping/interrupting of the graph, run the event loop often.

	* src/gnome-genius.c: don't allow executing code while somehting
	  else is running (for manual, answer copying and such)

Thu Feb 27 08:01:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: allow graphing more then one function and fix
	  an error with too high function values.

Wed Feb 26 14:19:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: plot every 2 pixels and optimize things a bit

Wed Feb 26 13:53:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: add ability to get doubles

	* src/graphing.[ch], src/gnome-genius.c, src/Makefile.am:  Add
	  very very rudimentary graphing support with the LinePlot function.
	  Doesn't make nice graphs but should be enough for
	  "seeing how f : R -> R" looks.

Wed Feb 26 10:06:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: Add Copy Answer As
	  Plain/LaTeX/MathML/Troff menu items (to make the gui version at
	  least somewhat more useful then the console version) and add
	  a default answer to avoid errors on copy before anything has been
	  entered.

	* doc/manual.txt: update to add the mathml mode

Wed Feb 26 09:27:24 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: improve a teeeny bit on the mathml mode.  Produces
	  Content MathML but I can't get mozilla to render mathml for me
	  properly so I can't test this.

Tue Feb 25 10:27:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/calc.[ch], src/funclib.c:
	  Add an experimental MathML output mode (for matrices only for now).
	  Can't quite get it to work though.

Mon Feb 24 15:58:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: add locale.h

	* src/gnome-genius.c: allow quitting while calculations are running
	  and add a "really want to quit dialog" to be replaced by "really
	  want to quit without saving state" dialog at some point in future.

	* src/eval.c: some leak hunting (still there are leaks)

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: better help string for Divides
 
	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: make the MillerRabin config
	  param 10 times larger for IsPrime, 10^-100 should be plenty
	  small

Fri Feb 21 14:05:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, src/mpwrap.[ch]: add IsGaussInteger,
	  IsComplexRational and IsPositiveInteger, also rename g
	  to Gravity

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: Add MillerRabinTest and use it
	  in IsPrime

	* lib/number_theory/*.gel: simplify argument checking in bunch of
	  places

	* src/calc.c, src/compil.[ch]: When reading compiled file allow
	  arbitrarily long record lines

Thu Feb 20 00:56:49 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/factoring.gel: it's too late and I can't think
	  and I commit things with syntax errors

Thu Feb 20 00:23:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/factoring.gel: implement FermatFactorization,
	  also use it as a last resort for the Factorize

Wed Feb 19 14:13:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: better prime caching, cache up to 30000 primes,
	  rename prime to Prime, add g, the gravity constant and add
	  EulerConstant (or gamma) good for about 9k digits, doesn't
	  calculate we have an actual representation in memory.

	* lib/number_theory/*.gel: Add RemoveFactor, add some help
	  strings remove SymbolicSquareRoot (sqrt does the job well)

Wed Feb 19 09:54:03 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: add Edit menu with Copy and Paste.

	* src/mpwrap.c: minor fix for rational power, and do possibly 
	  symbolic square root in case the denominator is 2, 4, 8 or 16
	  (should do more perhaps)

Sun Feb 16 11:06:50 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/eval.c, lib/number_theory/misc.gel:
	  use the powm function for power mod to make the modulo arithmetic
	  actually more useful.  Also implement numerator and denominator
	  for complex rational values.

Sat Feb 15 17:31:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/factoring.gel: increase the Factorize maximum
	  since we don't have any fun factoring algs so the trials is the
	  only thing we do.  Plus it's relatively fast.

Fri Feb 14 17:46:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/manual.txt: update

	* configure.in: raise version

Fri Feb 14 17:27:02 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/calc.c, src/parse.y, src/lexer.l: Better
	  printing of complex numbers still, add mode for (<expr>)i which
	  makes the expr imaginary (multiply by i really), and use this
	  for printing imaginary mixed fractions to look better.  Also
	  don't print parenthesis on toplevel complex numbers to look nicer
	  and pretty print now does toplevel.  Also don't toplevel on
	  printing a polynomial and when in toplevel mode don't
	  print whole numbers since that's the whole point of FullExpressions

	* src/eval.c: fix crash on setting parameters if there is an
	  exception

	* doc/manual.txt: update

Fri Feb 14 16:10:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/*.gel: add MaximalPrimePowerFactors,
	  PrimeFactors, fix Factors and add CombineFactorizations,
	  also make a better implementation of EulerPhi using Factorize,
	  which is a LOT faster then our previous braindead one.

	* src/util.[ch]: fixup the my_realloc to just use g_realloc. and
	  other minor cleanups

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/lexer.l, calc.c, compil.c: rework printing of
	  complex numbers, add latex/troff mode for fractions.  Allow
	  rational/integer complex numbers.  Add fixmes for den/num
	  functions for complex numbers.  For pure imaginary numbers just
	  print the imaginary part without parentheses.

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/geniustest.pl: add more tests, update
	  for changes and printout error inputs if any at the end

	* doc/manual.txt: update for the complex numbers

	* src/parse.y: ':' now binds less then the standard arithmetic
	  operators to fix stuff like foo@(2:a-1) to actually mean
	  foo@(2:(a-1)) and not foo@((2:a)-1)

Wed Feb 12 16:52:48 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parser.y: allow more matlabish notation for getting whole
	  rows and columns such as a@(3,:).  Still we do not support
	  the form a@(3,5:) and such.  Should not be hard to add though.

Mon Feb 10 09:23:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.spec.in: damnit why did I forget libexec ...

Mon Feb 10 08:57:04 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.2

Mon Feb 10 08:16:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, po/POTFILES.in: Fixed gettext/intltool
	  stuff to be correct and actually should work now, add missing files

Sun Feb 09 19:23:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: be consistent with which parentheis are printed in
	  latex mode since I always use [] and not () because I think that
	  looks neater, and since genius is my program I can make it
	  print whatever I want.  And damn is this nice for typing homework :)

Fri Jan 31 09:29:36 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: no need to mod after ref or rref since those will
	  in fact be handled by after function moding.

Wed Jan 29 14:01:54 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.[ch], src/funclib.c: mod matrices after gauss (gauss is
	  too stupid to mod ... no pun intended).  Allow negative powers
	  of matrices and division in mod mode.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some more tests

	* doc/manual.txt: update a bit

Wed Jan 29 10:20:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/gnome-genius.desktop.in: updated the
	  .desktop to be correct, add categories and install in the
	  vfolder location and all that good stuff

Mon Jan 27 14:30:40 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/manual.txt: a small update

Mon Jan 27 14:13:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am, doc/manual.txt,
	  README:  Move the manual to doc/manual.txt and install that
	  in the data directory

	* src/calc.c, src/funclib.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/genius.c:
	  add manual function to display manual, improve initial message,
	  info boxes in gui version now use textview and open up being
	  rather large, also always use the infobox for menuitems even if
	  console info printing is selected.

	* lib/calculus/limits.gel, lib/calculus/sums_products.gel, 
	  lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel, lib/number_theory/factoring.gel,
	  lib/number_theory/modulus.gel, lib/statistics/basic.gel:
	  Some naming fixes and a whole bunch of new help strings
	  
	* src/calc.[ch], src/eval.c, src/mpwrap.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/matop.c:
	  Rename error var type to GeniusError, on protected id set
	  tell us which id was it.

	* src/calc.c: don't display Ans as undocumented and add some initial
	  info to help and translate some strings

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some more tests

	* src/calc.h: up year in copyright string

Sun Jan 26 12:40:49 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: fix precedence of function definition to be FUNCTION
	  and not EQUALS

Sat Jan 25 15:59:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/equation_solving/find_root.gel, lib/misc/misc.gel:  A bit of
	  renaming and add some help strings

	* src/calc.c, src/geloutput.[ch], src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c,
	  src/structs.h:  Fixup help output a bit, and can get column count
	  of an output even if full expressions is true 

	* configure.in: raise version

Sat Jan 25 15:14:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel, src/eval.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/mpwrap.[ch]:  Use gmp functions to implement NextPrime,
	  IsPrimeProbability, LucasNumber and ModInvert.  Also implement
	  modular inversion when we encounter a ration in modular mode
	  and fix bug with pushing the modulus.

	* src/geniustests.txt: more tests

Fri Jan 24 14:16:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/modulus.gel: add implementation of EulerPhi

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: some parameter checking

Thu Jan 09 15:38:45 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/geloutput.[ch], src/calc.c: fix help output a bit to
	  obey terminal size

	* lib/combinatorics/factorial,gel: add Subfactorial

	* lib/combinatorics/misc.gel: whack some unimplemented functions

	* src/funclib.c: add GoldenRatio

	* src/gnome-genius.c: actually use the font we set

Thu Jan 09 11:14:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.[ch], src/funclib.c, src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c,
	  src/inter.c, src/lexer.l, src/mpwrap.[ch], src/testplugin.c:
	  Some internal cleanup, prefix some functions with gel_, add
	  a general printout infos function.  Whack the help entry in the
	  menu since there is no help, and add a warranty item that runs
	  the warranty function.  Also fix the hiding of the plugins menu.

Thu Jan 09 10:40:42 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/plugread.c, src/plugin.h, src/gnome-genius.c,
	  src/test.plugin.in:  Add a Hide= entry in the plugin description
	  and if true don't show the plugin in the gui.  Also if the
	  plugin menu is empty, then hide the whole toplevel menu.

Wed Jan 08 13:37:09 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/gnome-genius.c: move the helper program
	  to libexec

	* src/plugin.[ch], src/plug_api.h, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/gnome-genius.c, src/calc.c, src/plugread.[ch],
	  src/testplugin.c, src/genius.c: attempt to make the plugin
	  stuff a bit more usable and implement the save state and
	  restore state

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix saving of preferences, port the
	  error/info dialog to new gtk

	* src/eval.c, src/mpwrap.c, src/matrixw.c, src/lexer.l,
	  src/parse.y: fix warnings

	* configure.in: properly enable warnings

	  not really working

	* src/testplugin.c: implement some more functionality including
	  adding functions etc...

	* src/gnome-genius.c: some delete/bs fiddling, still not working
	  right for me though.  Also changed the logic for the fifo
	  creation

	* src/calc.c: fix plugin command to avoid an infinite input loop

Tue Jan 07 16:28:34 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: require vte since libzvt is broken and all that

	* src/calc.c: fix green color in help

	* src/genius-readline-helper.c, src/gnome-genius.c: port to vte
	  since libzvt is just giving me fits and we'll all use vte 
	  sooner or later

	* src/Makefile.am, src/gnome-genius.c: rename the readline helper

	  pivots 1 again

	* src/mpwrap.c: Fix two errors pointed out by Kai Arstila
	  <Kai.Arstila@Helsinki.FI>.  First fix rounding when first digit
	  is rounded.  Second fix arctan by using an implementation by
	  Guillermo Ballester Valor <gbv@oxixares.com> which I found on the
	  net.

Thu Dec 19 15:12:49 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.h, src/structs.h, src/eval.c, src/calc.c: start adding
	  some polynomial handling code.  Not much though.

Thu Dec 05 10:13:36 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel: add function for
	  eigenvalues, currently only for 2x2 and for triangular
	  matrices as special cases.

Sat Nov 23 10:13:15 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/*.gel: add RaleighQuotient, and reverse the

	* src/matrixw.c, src/mpwrap.c, src/plugin.c: Some leak hunting,
	  probably many leaks still left

Fri Nov 01 11:58:39 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: add a Combinations and Permutations function.  Also
	  fix checking for integers if complex numbers are passed

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel:  Whack GAMMA (use Combinations name),
	  and fix some other naming, fix complex DotProduct add InnerProduct
	  alias, switch arguemnts on JordanBlock, add OuterProduct of
	  vectors, clean up norms to reduce it to 2 functions

	* src/eval.c, src/matop.[ch], src/structs.h: Implement basic modular
	  arithmetic.  Not currently too smart but usable for basic modulo
	  operations. 

Wed Oct 30 15:40:09 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: fix optimization of the matrix expansion for 1x1
	  matrices

Wed Oct 30 15:37:24 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  a matrix

	* src/dict.[ch], src/calc.c, src/eval.[ch], src/funclib.c,
	  src/compil.c, parseutil.c, structs.h:  don't do local variable
	  substitution on function nodes.  Rather push them onto a special
	  stack (this bit is ugly) and then add a special dictionary
	  to the function on context pop with the local vars.  This
	  should work a lot nicer then the replacing that was going on
	  before.

Wed Oct 30 11:27:40 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c, src/eval.[ch], src/funclib.c, src/lexer.l, src/parse.y,
	  src/matrixw.[ch], src/parseutil.[ch]:  Add the : operator like
	  matlab has and accept vectors rather then just ranges for indexes
	  of matrices.  Also add IndexComplement to the builtin functions

	* src/gnome-genius.c: minor cleanup

	* src/geniustest.pl, src/geniustests.txt: update test suite

	* lib/*/*.gel: update for the new syntax

Wed Oct 23 21:59:46 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  functions such as IsNormal and IsUnitary and such

Wed Oct 23 21:34:43 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel: some renaming add a nicer

Wed Oct 23 20:56:11 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: whack restriction on desc string

	* src/matop.c, src/matrixw.c: Fix integer/rational caching

	* src/funclib.c: make gcd and lcm take multiple arguments or
	  a vector (or matrix).  Also rename PerfectSquare and PerfectPower
	  to IsPerfectSquare and IsPerfectPower

	* lib/number_theorey/*.gel: use the perfect functions above and
	  whack IsSquare

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel: add some determinantal
	  divisor whackiness for integer matrices (less useful, but good
	  for homework/learning), a bunch of related nonsense too

	* lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel: add IsUpperTriangular,
	  IsLowerTriangular, and IsDiagonal

Wed Oct 23 16:49:40 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

Wed Oct 23 15:29:37 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/special_matrices.gel: add HilberMatrix,
	  and Henkel matrix and add some docs and fix Vandermonde matrix
	  and add vander alias

Wed Oct 23 14:33:56 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel: add support for Compound matrices and
	  the GAMMA set (may need renaming, all index combination vectors of,
	  for using in submatrices)

Wed Oct 23 13:41:49 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/*.gel: add some help strings and implement

	* src/funclib.c: set call can take a string

	* src/disc.c: fix global set

	* src/eval.[ch], src/parse.y, src/calc.c: allow passing of

	* Big fixing.  Basically apply the below patches to the 0.4.6 tree
	  remove the new context rewrite, fix a bunch of errors and crashes
	  and generally make the whole thing work.  Next up will be to
	  port it to gnome2 at some point though I think I might keep it
	  at gnome 1 level out of laziness.  I also fixed up all the
	  copyright notices.  I'm really keen on using genius again for my
	  homework/research and thus all this is happening.
	  Yay! Genius is not dead!

	  possible without a parser, but it should be ok for normal use
	  and only differs in functionality in cases of errors (or should)

1999-05-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: Check for termcap, then use -ltermcap in the
	readline check only if termcap was found (some readlines don't 
	require -ltermcap apparently)

	* struct.h,dict.[ch],calc.c,eval.c,lexer.l: slight changes in naming
	  to be more consistent

	* calc.[ch],genius.c: added function to add missing parentheses
	  on the end of expression to calc, and made it do just that
	  in genius.c

	* genius.c: the entrybox is cleared after an expression is evaluated

Sat Jan 10 00:45:07 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* lexer.l,parse.y,eval.[ch]: added logical and,or,xor and not
	  operators. ! was not touched and still means factorial

	* README: updated

	* Makefile.am: using YACCFLAGS for arguments instead fo YACC

	* eval.c,calc.c: messed with the expression printing to at
	  least print something debuggable before making it right

	* eval.c: secondright is now copied, this fixes ifelse

	* lexer.l: fixed a bug in argument references during parse

	* eval.c: while doesn't check for a number (it does it's
	  own evaluation), but it still seems broken

Fri Jan 09 21:05:18 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: couple of minor changes, Ctrl-Q now also quits

	* eval.[ch]: added if,while and ifelse construct operations, also
	  reversed how branches returns the argument (it was wrong) and
	  made a function for telling which ones should get evaluated during
	  calculations (evalnode)

	* structs.h, eval.[ch]: added a secondright argument to primitives
	  since ifelse needs it

	* parse.y: added the parsing info for while,if,ifelse. lexer already
	  included it

	* eval.c: split up evalnode to several functions

	* README: updated

	* eval.h: took out an obscolete prototype

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.l: added comparison operators,
	  ==,!=,<=>,>,<,>=,<=

	* genius.c: ! taken out of the numpad, % put in

Fri Jan 09 16:17:38 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.c: fixed another bug in copynode, this fixes some segfaults,
	  and makes global functions work, local ones still segfault

	* eval.c: fixed a bug in evaluation, first evaluate left THEN
	  the right side. this caused trouble with separators and
	  function declarations

	* calc.c: the parse error message now says "before" instead of
	  "at" since it makes more sense

Fri Jan 09 02:08:11 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.l,dict.c: took function declaration from
	  parse time to execution time. Still segfaults all over the place

	* eval.c: fixed copynode, added function for adding fake function
	  nodes for declarations

Thu Jan 08 00:11:22 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* README: updated to reflect the changes

	* COPYING: added

	* genius.c: make floats ints is now disabled by default as
	  it is not too intuitive, meaning it might not do what a user
	  expects

Wed Jan 07 23:44:13 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* dict.[ch]: addfunc now returns a pointer to the actual created
	  record

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.y: added a separator primitive, all it does is
	  right side. meaning you can have more expressions after each other
	  and taht will return the value of the last one

	* dict.[ch]: created dictionary contexts so that local
	  variables/functions are possible

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.y,funclib.c: added user function support, not
	  yet completely finished, but it is working quite nicely already,
	  recursion does not yet work and I know what's the problem and will
	  fix it, though there are not yet any structures for programming,
	  there are many MANY small changes around these files to support this

Tue Jan 06 18:38:17 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch],parse.y: added mod ('%') operator

Tue Jan 06 15:38:49 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: Make use of the app widget, get rid of buttons in favor of
	  menus, use gnome_init instead of gtk_init, add #include <gnome.h>

Mon Jan 05 23:14:56 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.c,calc.c,structs.h: changed some tree_t internals to
	  match the new constant names

	* eval.c,struct.c: it should be now possible to evaluate user
	  which are just compiled into evaluation trees

	* util.[ch]: took out makelc

	* dict.[ch]: made searches case sensitive and added support for
	  user functions

	* lexer.l,parser.y: added support for no-argument user functions
	  (variables) setting

	* calc.c: fixed a bug so that the builtin functions don't get
	  added again and again

	* eval.[ch]: added the '=' operation and changed evalexp to be able
	  to set variables

Sun Jan 04 23:50:25 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: accelerator stuff revamped, and all is done through
	  the keypress event, nothing will happen on empty string

Sun Jan 04 22:59:28 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: Got the keybindings to work, so it can be completely
	  keyboard driven. ^C quits \n runs calculations.

Sun Jan 04 20:57:01 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.[ch],eval.c,genius.c: implemented calcstate structure,
	  instead of separate variables

	* genius.c: added some options for the new calcstate structure
	  these are the make results floats and scientific notation

	* calc.c: if the number of digits is reduced the number is now
	  rounded, implemented scientific notation, implemented conversion
	  to floats, some cleanup, a typo fixed

	* lexer.l: can now read integers in scientific notation as
	  floats

	* structs.h,calc.c,eval.c: changed some enum constants' names to
	  be more meaningful

	* dict.c: small typo to make builtin functions

	* eval.c: some cleanup, reduced the number of temporaries used in
	  some operations, put switch statements in the code instead of
	  some if/else structures

	* mymath.c: mympf_pow_ui now safely works when rop and op are one
	  and the same number (it will still not use a temp when the numbers
	  are in fact different)

Sat Jan 03 16:57:17 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.c, eval.c: it's possible to have functions in uncomputed
	  expressions, they will display properly

	* funclib.[ch]: deleted test_op ("test" function), added functions
	  "cos", "tan", "pi", "e"

	* mymath.[ch]: created these files for some helper gmp functions

	* eval.c: taken out mympf_pow_ui and put it into mymath.[ch]
	  added an ugly ans slow temporary way to do exponentials of
	  floats, it converts it to a rational first

Sat Jan 03 12:48:31 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.[ch]: deleted old unused functions, added prototypes
	  to genius.h, added errorreporting functions

	* calc.c, eval.c: now use the error reporting function

Sat Jan 03 02:18:55 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch], calc.c, parse.y: the stack is now a structure of type
	  evalstack_t, it's a dynamic array now

	* eval.c: added #include "util.h"

	* util.c: made my_realloc safer

	* funclib.c: added #include <gmp.h>

	* funclib.[ch]: sine function added ("sin"), works only for -pi<x<pi

Sat Jan 03 00:37:52 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* util.c: proper casting in makelc

	* dict.c: makebifunc now doesn't segfault.

	* dict.c: d_addfunc fixed, it adds dictinary entries now

	* eval.c: added NULL checking to freetree and freetree now does
	  freeargs, not freenode and makefuncd sets n->left and right to
	  NULL ... that made ugly segfaults

	* eval.c: evalnode now evaluates function args correctly

Fri Jan 02 21:21:27 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.h: removed FACTORIAL_ERROR since it's not a fatal error

	* eval.c: Should be able to run functions from funclib

	* funclib.[ch]: removed funclib_exec function since that's
	  obscolete, added addall and test_op functions and there's a
	  "test" function returns sum of three arguments (no typechecking
	  is done and they have to be integers! it's just a testroutine)

	* calc.c: added #include "funclib.h", and it will add all the
	  funclib functions the first time evalexpr is run.
