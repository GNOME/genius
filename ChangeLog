Fri Mar 19 17:42:38 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: properly interrupt on Ctrl-C and also whack
	  the readbuf* which weren't used anymore

Fri Mar 19 16:52:18 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: use GtkFileChooser if compiled with a new
	  enough gtk+, but still allow compilation with GtkFileSelector
	  in case old gtk+ is used.  Also fix up some strings.  Finally
	  add .gel as the file extension on Save As.. if no extension
	  was used.

	* configure.in: fixup a bit

Fri Mar 19 11:11:01 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: apparently separator setting is just plain
	  ignored for message dialogs so don't set it (avoids unsightly
	  GTK+ warnings with new GTK+)

Fri Mar 19 11:05:00 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.[ch], src/calc.c: translate e^x to exp(x) since that is
	  more precise

	* src/mpwrap.c: better error reporting for inverses, better random
	  number seeding, fix of mpw_randint function if rop==op, and minor
	  general cleanup

	* configure.in: raise version

Wed Mar 10 21:22:00 2004 Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@computer.org>

	* configure.in: Added ga to ALL_LINGUAS (Irish).

Tue Jan 20 15:56:30 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/special_matrices.gel: add rotation matrices

Wed Dec 31 14:41:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.7.1

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix spinners being too thin

Wed Dec 31 12:04:56 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.7

Wed Dec 31 11:40:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: mpwfr_pow is kind of broken in gmp 4.1.2 at least
	  (seems fixed in newer mpfr, will have to do some sort of a check
	  in the future).

	* lib/functions/elementary.gel: add ErrorFunction/erf

	* lib/functions/sums_products.gel: add InfiniteProduct and
	  InfiniteProduct2

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests

	* Makefile.am: add intltool-modules/XML/Parser/Style/OrigTree.pm
	  to EXTRA_DIST

	* configure.in: raise version, whack the DEPRECATED things

Fri Dec 12 10:31:55 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/subspaces.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel:  Fix Kernel([0]) (it gave
	  correct answer, but also gave errors) and do some cleanup
	  as well

Wed Oct 29 16:59:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: allow very very very large powers of 1,-1,1i and -1i.
	  also ui divisions should return an int if the denominator is 1

Tue Oct 28 10:15:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: be nicer in integer powers of pure imaginary
	  integers/rationals

Thu Oct 16 10:21:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.6

	* src/Makefile.am: fix build

2003-10-15  Jordi Mallach  <jordi@sindominio.net>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added "ca" (Catalan).

Tue Oct 07 15:08:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version

	* configure.in, src/calc.c, src/compil.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/gnome-genius.c, src/graphing.c:  Whack use of
	  all deprecated stuff.  Also make the graphing canvas
	  use monospace 10 and not 12

Tue Oct 07 10:04:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, src/plugin.c,
	  src/plugread.c, src/genius.c: Kill gnome dependency in
	  the command line genius by using ve-config and
	  vicious-extensions.  Only codewise though, it is still linked
	  to gnome.  Though that should not be too hard to fix and
	  non-gnome non-gui builds may again be possible.  Not to mention
	  that startup of non-gui code is faster meaning faster testing
	  and less other whacky code to screw up valgrind runs etc...

	* src/mpwrap.c: fix corruption with respect to extra types when
	  rop == op1 or op2 and reenable the no_convert extra type
	  optimization.  Also fixes a leak of gmp internal data on all
	  divisions and gcd and mod operations.

Mon Oct 06 18:02:07 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: revert the change (sort of) something is wrong,
	  and I don't have time to investigate

Mon Oct 06 17:47:26 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: during some operations we were unnecessairly
	  converting the rop only to wipe it, so add a no_convert version
	  of the extra type function (affected are division and mod in case
	  rop was of a different type)

Mon Oct 06 17:00:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/misc/misc.gel: add Identity function

	* lib/calculus/differentiation.gel, lib/calculus/limits.gel,
	  lib/functions/numerical.gel: Tolerances should be floats really

	* configure.in, lib/Makefile.am, lib/sets/Makefile.am,
	  lib/sets/basic.gel, lib/misc/misc.gel:  Move the set theoretic
	  functions from misc to new dir called 'sets'

	* lib/functions/numerical.gel: add aliases Sign and AbsoluteValue

	* src/calc.c, src/compil.c, src/dict.h, src/eval.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/graphing.c, src/matrixw.h, src/mpwrap.[ch], src/mpzextra.c,
	  src/structs.h:  Some minor cleanup all over the place, plus 
	  more reordering and other struct tricks to reduce footprint of
	  common structures even further.

2003-10-05  Danilo Šegan  <dsegan@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Added "sr" and "sr@Latn" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Fri Sep 26 18:46:32 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/structs.h, src/eval.c: shave 4 bytes off the GelETree (at least
	  on x86) The savings will be invisible on archs with alignment.  So
	  we're down at 20 bytes per GelETree node (plus any data of course)

2003-09-01  Metin Amiroff  <metin@karegen.com>

	configure.in: Added "az" in ALL_LINGUAS.

Sun Aug 31 23:27:00 2003  Wang Jian  <lark@linux.net.cn>

	* configure.in: Added "zh_CN" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Thu Aug 28 23:29:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.[ch], src/dict.[ch], src/eval.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/inter.c, src/lexer.l,
	  src/mpwrap.c, src/structs.h:  Can't sleep so doing general
	  cleanup such as using standard argument checking for functions,
	  fixing up error output, converting to gel_errorout/infoout,
	  and s/int/gboolean/ where appropriate.  Also fixed up the
	  function structure to save sizeof(int) bytes per function.

Thu Aug 28 17:51:35 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: move stuff to generalized function parameter
	  handling as possible.  Should make translations easier.  Also
	  accept identifiers in places where it makes sense to (SetHelp,
	  protect, and such) and add a bunch of G_UNLIKELY/G_LIKELY's

Wed Aug 27 18:06:05 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/dict.c: initialize the function structures correctly.

Thu Aug 21 12:21:16 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: also set the PRIMARY and not just CLIPBOARD on
	  the special copy items

Sat Aug 16 18:58:56 2003  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

	* configure.in: Added "hi" for Hindi in ALL_LINGUAS.

Fri Aug 15 02:39:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c, src/eval.c, src/calc.c: go wild with G_LIKELY
	  and G_UNLIKELY, some cleanup, fix two very minor leaks.

Mon Jul 28 10:35:26 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h: check for ncurses as well if libtermcap
	  isn't found

	* src/genius.c: use GETTEXT_PACKAGE and not PACKAGE

Thu Jul 24 17:24:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: I hate it when I apply half of a patch.  in any
	  case yet again from the FreeBSD ports: the glob usage was wrong

Thu Jul 24 17:22:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: when wordexp is missing and we use glob but
	  we weren't including glob.h  (from the FreeBSD ports)

Thu Jun 12 14:17:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: load programs from command line

Thu Jun 12 14:09:34 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, genius.lang, src/gnome-genius.c: add
	  optional GtkSourceView support and add highlighting with that.
	  I should figure out the mime type mess and install all this stuff
	  so that even gedit can get highlighting for gel files.

Wed Jun 11 11:27:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius-readline-helper.c, src/inter.c: change directory in the
	  readline helper, and update the helper completion routine to match
	  inter.c

Fri Jun 06 16:25:15 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: the preference dialog has hig ordered buttons
	  and all the other dialogs also now lack the separator thingie.

Mon Jun 02 13:32:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.5 

	* src/gnome-genius.c: when we go to the last error there was an
	  "off by one" error

Mon Jun 02 13:18:53 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/geniustests.txt: add test for sqrt with mod

	* src/gnome-genius.c: print line number in the statusbar, and on
	  error place the cursor at the point of the last error (kind of
	  a hack, should somehow mark all errors)

Mon Jun 02 10:13:13 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: fix resetting the modulo after recursive eval call
	  (was a crash)

	* src/funclib.c, src/calc.[ch]: a lot of messages are now unified
	  for ease of translation and argument checking is done with
	  helper routines.  Also when the sqrt is called with mod try calling
	  the SqrtModPrime or erroring out.

Sun Jun 01 09:14:06 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/modulus.gel: add
	  SilverPohligHellmanWithFactorization function which does the
	  discrete log but knowing the factorization of q-1, so if you do
	  a bunch of discrete logs this can be a lot faster.

Sat May 31 15:11:04 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/numbertheory/modulus.gel: add IsPrimitiveModWithPrimeFactors,
	  which is like IsPrimitiveMod, but we already put in the
	  prime factors of q-1, so this is faster if we are testing a whole
	  bunch of numbers or if we know factorization of q-1 beforehand.
	  Use this for the primitive element finding routines.
	  Also add SqrtModPrime which computes square roots modulo a prime.

	* src/gnome-genius.c: Fix saving and opening of files (DOH!) also
	  set the filename and the directory each time when openning the
	  fileselector so that you don't have to retype everything.

	* src/calc.c, src/funclib.c: rename an easter egg to prevent
	  name conflict

Fri May 30 17:13:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: print out errors/infos after program run.  DOH!

Wed May 28 16:57:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.4

	* src/gnome-genius.desktop.in: add Office category keyword

Wed May 28 16:37:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: implement save and save as (at least
	  somewhat sanely).  Cut/Copy/Paste are now implemented for
	  the program panes.  If we are leaving the program the 'are you
	  sure' message takes into account if there are any unsaved
	  progs.

Wed May 28 13:32:39 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: smarter dialog behaviour for open and load,
	  and add a reload menu item and also do some de-deprecation

Wed May 28 10:17:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: cleanup the program stuff a bit, add a programs
	  menu and make selected program stick even if you switch to console
	  to be able to run multiple times easily.

Tue May 27 17:47:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: implement open file, mark changed files
	  as changed, the toolbar has now open and not load and load label
	  changed to "Load and Run" to be clear

Tue May 27 16:59:54 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/lexer.[lh], src/calc.[chl, src/gnome-genius.c,
	  src/genius.c:  The my_yy_ functions are now gel_lexer_ functions
	  and lexer.l is installed.

	* src/gnome-genius.c: Implement tabs as programs using text view,
	  and allow running of these tabs as programs with output to main
	  console.  No openning/saving functionality yet.

Tue May 27 14:18:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/misc/misc.gel: add Compose function to compose two functions

Tue May 27 14:07:16 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/modulus.gel: add IndexCalculus,
	  IndexCalculusPrecalculation, FindPrimitiveElementMod and
	  FindRandomPrimitiveElementMod functions that I did for class
	  a while back.

Tue May 27 13:11:00 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: fix the gmp accessors

	* src/mpzextra.[ch], src/funclib.c, lib/number_theory/factoring.gel:
	  snarf the Pollard-Rho implementation from gmp examples and use it
	  for a built in version of Factorize, and whack the gel one and
	  also whack FactorizeLoopMax as it doesn't make sense now.  Also
	  add possibility to interrupt the primality tests (except when
	  inside mpz_millerrabin).

	* src/eval.c: if an interruption is raised during a built in
	  function call, then raise exception.

Wed May 21 16:42:05 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: the int power functions were stupid and weren't
	  working for greater then ulong powers anyway.  So for the floating
	  one convert to a float if the power is too big, for the integer
	  one just make an error, since the number would be too big to be
	  useful (as an integer of course)

Wed May 21 16:06:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: allow access to the low level gmp types

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel, src/mpzextra.[ch], src/mpwrap.[ch],
	  src/funclib.[ch], src/Makefile.am:
	  rework the prime testing stuff.  Use the mpz MillerRabin test,
	  and also snatch the strong pseudoprime test from gmp and make it
	  internal and whack StrongPseudoprimeSub.  MillerRabinTest now
	  takes the number of reps as an argument (an integer) and not an
	  epsilon!  IsPrime is rewritten internally as well for speed using
	  first mpz_probab_prime_p for the trial factoring, and then strong
	  pseudoprime tests for 2,3,5,7 and then some Miller-Rabin for good
	  measure.  Whack the IsPrimeLoopMax and PrimeProbabilityEpsilon
	  parameters and add IsPrimeMillerRabinReps parameter.  Whack the
	  IsPrimeProbability since it doesn't fit with the above and IsPrime
	  really does that.  MillerRabinTestSure is also now internal.

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/funclib.c: the EulerConstant is now taken
	  from MPFR if available instead of compiling in the long string
	  version and reading that each time.

	* src/funclib.c: a little bit of argument checking cleanup.

	* lib/functions/elementary.gel, src/mpwrap.c: Use MPFR for log10
	  and log2, or do some these functions internally with ln, also
	  add lg as an alias to log2

	* src/geniustests.txt: fix a wrong test (misread strong pseudoprime
	  and pseudoprime. 341 is the first pseudoprime to base 2,
	  not strong pseudoprime to base 2.  Also add some tests, and remove
	  tests for IsPrimeProbability.

Mon Apr 28 18:04:00 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: allow null for the set in the "for in" type loops to
	  just mean empty

	* lib/misc/misc.gel: Implement MakeSet, Union, Intersection and
	  document SetMinus and IsIn

	* src/funclib.c: add a "Set Theory" category for help

Mon Apr 28 17:33:37 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, src/eval.[ch], src/structs.h: implement the
	  no_mod_all_args flag.  Add flag setting function to the
	  standard lib.  Use the no_mod_all_args flag on builtin C
	  functions where it makes sense (I, zeros, ones, rand, randint)
	  Also implement the GetCurrentModulo() function to get the
	  modulo of the calling context.

	* lib/functions/elementary.gel: the log function only takes an
	  optional base argument and without it acts as ln.  Also we look at
	  the modulo of the calling context and call DiscreteLog in case
	  there is one so "log(13,6) mod 229" works as it should.

Fri Apr 25 16:41:13 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/compil.c, src/funclib.c, src/structs.h: allow mod propagation
	  into function, at least for built in ones and propagate into ref,
	  rref, and SolveLinearSystem

	* src/eval.[ch], src/matop.[ch]: attempt at mod awaring the gauss function
	  but it fails horribly unless we are in a finite field.

	* src/eval.c: fix a very small leak in loops and a very large leak in
	  evaluating and/or expressions

	* src/parse.y: mod now binds tighter then logical operators to make
	  things as "if a == b mod n and a == c mod n then ..." work properly
	  also call binds tighter then the logical operators then

	* src/calc.c: when function is undocumented, print at least a
	  prototype

	* src/matop.c: gauss correctly returns TRUE/FALSE even if stopsing
	  is FALSE

	* src/funclib.c: add SolveLinearSystem function that solves general
	  linear systems easily.  zeros and ones can now take only one
	  argument and that just gives a row vector.

Mon Apr 21 20:23:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: elements, rows, columns accept
	  null and treat it as 0x0 matrix

Wed Apr 16 11:14:32 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/compil.c: kill useless assert

	* lib/calculus/integration.gel: add NumericalIntegral which calls
	  some integral rule with steps as set by the parameters

Wed Apr 16 11:03:54 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/calculus/integration.gel: add MidpointRule to make quicker
	  calculations

Mon Apr 14 14:35:39 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: allow return after comma to break a long vector input

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: add ConvertToBase and ConvertFromBase

Mon Mar 24 22:07:33 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/modulus.gel: add reference for the
	  DiscreteLog algorithm, add IsPrimitiveMod function

Mon Mar 24 21:54:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel, lib/number_theory/modulus.gel,
	  src/geniustests.txt:  Implemented CRT (ChineseRemainder) and
	  DiscreteLog (Silver-Pohlig-Hellman for F_q where q a prime) 
	  for homework.  Should really be built in, but for now we have to
	  get by with this.

Mon Mar 24 15:04:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: mod matrices after primitives, and add a fixme,
	  most operations already do modding so this is not very efficent,
	  but at least it's correct for now.  Fixes for example
	  "-[1] mod 2"

Mon Mar 24 14:31:29 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/dict.c, src/eval.c: fix var substitution crash, and add
	  some memory debug friendliness

Mon Mar 10 13:10:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel, lib/number_theory/misc.gel:
	  add AreRelativelyPrime function and fix the IsStrongPseudoprime
	  function

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some tests

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: add LeastAbsoluteResidue function

Mon Mar 10 11:49:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, src/eval.[ch], src/mpwrap.[ch]:  Add IsEven and
	  IsOdd using the native gmp functions for speed improvement.  Also
	  add StringToASCII, ASCIIToString, AlphabetToString and
	  StringToAlphabet functions to make doing some cryptography stuff
	  easier.

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: whack IsEven and IsOdd

Mon Mar 10 10:55:14 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: add MillerRabinTestSure, which
	  tests primes in O((log n)^5) time that is a deterministic
	  algorithm (given Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is true)

Mon Mar 10 10:44:40 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theorey/primes.gel: improve on the
	  Miller-Rabin test to optimize things a bit and add
	  IsStrongPseudoprimeSub which must already get
	  a and t where n-1 = 2^a * t, so that this doesn't have
	  to be computed over and over.

Wed Mar 05 14:14:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.3

Wed Mar 05 14:13:03 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c, src/parseutil.c: when expanding matrices treat nulls
	  as empty matrices to allow easy appending, prepending and all such
	  stuff.

	* src/calc.c: be anal on printing numbers with powers and factorials
	  so that the output is genius parsable

Sat Mar 01 10:03:32 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: on setting FloatPrecision actually break e and
	  GoldenRatio caches to recalculate (reread) these

Sat Mar 01 09:55:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: rational powers now use mpz_root to return an integer
	  if possible.

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: remove SymbolicNthRoot and do smarter
	  IsNthRoot given the new usage of powers

Fri Feb 28 13:32:46 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: play with graph colors, make graph lines 1.5 thick,
	  add a plot progress indicator

	* src/mpwrap.c: fix conversions to int and rational from float

	* doc/manual.txt: add a note about unitary minus

Fri Feb 28 11:55:15 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: raise precision back to 256
	  bits as mpfr is blazing fast on that as well.

Fri Feb 28 11:11:56 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], configure.in, src/Makefile.am:  If MPFR is present
	  use it for functions like sin, cos, atan, pow, log, exp.  This
	  increases speed of those operations by a LOT (simple test gave
	  about 10 times the speedup).  Still you can use genius without
	  mpfr, since it usually doesn't seem to be present in GMP packages
	  since packagers tend to not add --enable-mpfr (I don't know why
	  it's not the default).  In any case since mpfr is a static library
	  so far I think builds that I make on my system will work for people
	  with the standard GMP package from redhat.

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/genius.c: add a note in case MPFR isn't
	  compiled in to the copyright string so that people know if they
	  are running without it.

Thu Feb 27 18:07:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c, src/lexer.l, src/parse.y, src/eval.[ch], src/calc.c:
	  Make UMINUS bind less then factorials and powers and have factorials
	  bind tighter then powers but then fixup the tree to make things
	  like -1^k still come out as (-1)^k (but -a^k is -(a^k)).  One
	  of those WYMIWYG things.

	* src/graphing.c: fixup labels a bit

	* src/calc.c: when printing a power be specific about how to parse
	  any UMINUS

Thu Feb 27 16:56:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.[ch], src/eval.[ch]: Copy the token into functions
	  when we eval them to be able to identify them.  And label functions
	  on the graph by their token or their body if it is less then 64
	  characters long.  Also fix problems with too ofset plot window.
	  The default plotwindow is now a parameter called LinePlotWindow.

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: make default precision 128
	  since it will make things faster.  Currently <anything>^float
	  and exponentials and logs are utterly slow, even in lower
	  precision.

Thu Feb 27 10:17:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c, src/graphing.c, src/inter.c: graph progressively
	  to show how far we got.  Fix a long standing bug with getting an
	  unusable prompt if interrupt is hit without anything running.

Thu Feb 27 09:55:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: make graph window a dialog, allow
	  stopping/interrupting of the graph, run the event loop often.

	* src/gnome-genius.c: don't allow executing code while somehting
	  else is running (for manual, answer copying and such)

Thu Feb 27 08:01:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: allow graphing more then one function and fix
	  an error with too high function values.

Wed Feb 26 14:19:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/graphing.c: plot every 2 pixels and optimize things a bit

Wed Feb 26 13:53:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch]: add ability to get doubles

	* src/graphing.[ch], src/gnome-genius.c, src/Makefile.am:  Add
	  very very rudimentary graphing support with the LinePlot function.
	  Doesn't make nice graphs but should be enough for
	  "seeing how f : R -> R" looks.

Wed Feb 26 10:06:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c: Add Copy Answer As
	  Plain/LaTeX/MathML/Troff menu items (to make the gui version at
	  least somewhat more useful then the console version) and add
	  a default answer to avoid errors on copy before anything has been
	  entered.

	* doc/manual.txt: update to add the mathml mode

Wed Feb 26 09:27:24 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: improve a teeeny bit on the mathml mode.  Produces
	  Content MathML but I can't get mozilla to render mathml for me
	  properly so I can't test this.

Tue Feb 25 10:27:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/calc.[ch], src/funclib.c:
	  Add an experimental MathML output mode (for matrices only for now).
	  Can't quite get it to work though.

Mon Feb 24 15:58:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: add locale.h

	* src/gnome-genius.c: allow quitting while calculations are running
	  and add a "really want to quit dialog" to be replaced by "really
	  want to quit without saving state" dialog at some point in future.

	* src/eval.c: some leak hunting (still there are leaks)

	* lib/number_theory/misc.gel: better help string for Divides
 
	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: make the MillerRabin config
	  param 10 times larger for IsPrime, 10^-100 should be plenty
	  small

Fri Feb 21 14:05:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c, src/mpwrap.[ch]: add IsGaussInteger,
	  IsComplexRational and IsPositiveInteger, also rename g
	  to Gravity

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: Add MillerRabinTest and use it
	  in IsPrime

	* lib/number_theory/*.gel: simplify argument checking in bunch of
	  places

	* src/calc.c, src/compil.[ch]: When reading compiled file allow
	  arbitrarily long record lines

Thu Feb 20 00:56:49 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/factoring.gel: it's too late and I can't think
	  and I commit things with syntax errors

Thu Feb 20 00:23:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/factoring.gel: implement FermatFactorization,
	  also use it as a last resort for the Factorize

Wed Feb 19 14:13:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: better prime caching, cache up to 30000 primes,
	  rename prime to Prime, add g, the gravity constant and add
	  EulerConstant (or gamma) good for about 9k digits, doesn't
	  calculate we have an actual representation in memory.

	* lib/number_theory/*.gel: Add RemoveFactor, add some help
	  strings remove SymbolicSquareRoot (sqrt does the job well)

Wed Feb 19 09:54:03 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gnome-genius.c: add Edit menu with Copy and Paste.

	* src/mpwrap.c: minor fix for rational power, and do possibly 
	  symbolic square root in case the denominator is 2, 4, 8 or 16
	  (should do more perhaps)

Sun Feb 16 11:06:50 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/eval.c, lib/number_theory/misc.gel:
	  use the powm function for power mod to make the modulo arithmetic
	  actually more useful.  Also implement numerator and denominator
	  for complex rational values.

Sat Feb 15 17:31:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/factoring.gel: increase the Factorize maximum
	  since we don't have any fun factoring algs so the trials is the
	  only thing we do.  Plus it's relatively fast.

Fri Feb 14 17:46:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/manual.txt: update

	* configure.in: raise version

Fri Feb 14 17:27:02 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/calc.c, src/parse.y, src/lexer.l: Better
	  printing of complex numbers still, add mode for (<expr>)i which
	  makes the expr imaginary (multiply by i really), and use this
	  for printing imaginary mixed fractions to look better.  Also
	  don't print parenthesis on toplevel complex numbers to look nicer
	  and pretty print now does toplevel.  Also don't toplevel on
	  printing a polynomial and when in toplevel mode don't
	  print whole numbers since that's the whole point of FullExpressions

	* src/eval.c: fix crash on setting parameters if there is an
	  exception

	* doc/manual.txt: update

Fri Feb 14 16:10:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/*.gel: add MaximalPrimePowerFactors,
	  PrimeFactors, fix Factors and add CombineFactorizations,
	  also make a better implementation of EulerPhi using Factorize,
	  which is a LOT faster then our previous braindead one.

	* src/util.[ch]: fixup the my_realloc to just use g_realloc. and
	  other minor cleanups

	* src/mpwrap.[ch], src/lexer.l, calc.c, compil.c: rework printing of
	  complex numbers, add latex/troff mode for fractions.  Allow
	  rational/integer complex numbers.  Add fixmes for den/num
	  functions for complex numbers.  For pure imaginary numbers just
	  print the imaginary part without parentheses.

	* src/geniustests.txt, src/geniustest.pl: add more tests, update
	  for changes and printout error inputs if any at the end

	* doc/manual.txt: update for the complex numbers

	* src/parse.y: ':' now binds less then the standard arithmetic
	  operators to fix stuff like foo@(2:a-1) to actually mean
	  foo@(2:(a-1)) and not foo@((2:a)-1)

Wed Feb 12 16:52:48 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parser.y: allow more matlabish notation for getting whole
	  rows and columns such as a@(3,:).  Still we do not support
	  the form a@(3,5:) and such.  Should not be hard to add though.

Mon Feb 10 09:23:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.spec.in: damnit why did I forget libexec ...

Mon Feb 10 08:57:04 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.5.2

Mon Feb 10 08:16:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, po/POTFILES.in: Fixed gettext/intltool
	  stuff to be correct and actually should work now, add missing files

Sun Feb 09 19:23:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: be consistent with which parentheis are printed in
	  latex mode since I always use [] and not () because I think that
	  looks neater, and since genius is my program I can make it
	  print whatever I want.  And damn is this nice for typing homework :)

Fri Jan 31 09:29:36 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: no need to mod after ref or rref since those will
	  in fact be handled by after function moding.

Wed Jan 29 14:01:54 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.[ch], src/funclib.c: mod matrices after gauss (gauss is
	  too stupid to mod ... no pun intended).  Allow negative powers
	  of matrices and division in mod mode.

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some more tests

	* doc/manual.txt: update a bit

Wed Jan 29 10:20:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/gnome-genius.desktop.in: updated the
	  .desktop to be correct, add categories and install in the
	  vfolder location and all that good stuff

Mon Jan 27 14:30:40 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/manual.txt: a small update

Mon Jan 27 14:13:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am, doc/manual.txt,
	  README:  Move the manual to doc/manual.txt and install that
	  in the data directory

	* src/calc.c, src/funclib.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/genius.c:
	  add manual function to display manual, improve initial message,
	  info boxes in gui version now use textview and open up being
	  rather large, also always use the infobox for menuitems even if
	  console info printing is selected.

	* lib/calculus/limits.gel, lib/calculus/sums_products.gel, 
	  lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel, lib/number_theory/factoring.gel,
	  lib/number_theory/modulus.gel, lib/statistics/basic.gel:
	  Some naming fixes and a whole bunch of new help strings
	  
	* src/calc.[ch], src/eval.c, src/mpwrap.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c, src/matop.c:
	  Rename error var type to GeniusError, on protected id set
	  tell us which id was it.

	* src/calc.c: don't display Ans as undocumented and add some initial
	  info to help and translate some strings

	* src/geniustests.txt: add some more tests

	* src/calc.h: up year in copyright string

Sun Jan 26 12:40:49 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: fix precedence of function definition to be FUNCTION
	  and not EQUALS

Sat Jan 25 15:59:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/equation_solving/find_root.gel, lib/misc/misc.gel:  A bit of
	  renaming and add some help strings

	* src/calc.c, src/geloutput.[ch], src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c,
	  src/structs.h:  Fixup help output a bit, and can get column count
	  of an output even if full expressions is true 

	* configure.in: raise version

Sat Jan 25 15:14:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel, src/eval.c, src/funclib.c,
	  src/mpwrap.[ch]:  Use gmp functions to implement NextPrime,
	  IsPrimeProbability, LucasNumber and ModInvert.  Also implement
	  modular inversion when we encounter a ration in modular mode
	  and fix bug with pushing the modulus.

	* src/geniustests.txt: more tests

Fri Jan 24 14:16:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/number_theory/modulus.gel: add implementation of EulerPhi

	* lib/number_theory/primes.gel: some parameter checking

Thu Jan 09 15:38:45 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/geloutput.[ch], src/calc.c: fix help output a bit to
	  obey terminal size

	* lib/combinatorics/factorial,gel: add Subfactorial

	* lib/combinatorics/misc.gel: whack some unimplemented functions

	* src/funclib.c: add GoldenRatio

	* src/gnome-genius.c: actually use the font we set

Thu Jan 09 11:14:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.[ch], src/funclib.c, src/genius.c, src/gnome-genius.c,
	  src/inter.c, src/lexer.l, src/mpwrap.[ch], src/testplugin.c:
	  Some internal cleanup, prefix some functions with gel_, add
	  a general printout infos function.  Whack the help entry in the
	  menu since there is no help, and add a warranty item that runs
	  the warranty function.  Also fix the hiding of the plugins menu.

Thu Jan 09 10:40:42 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/plugread.c, src/plugin.h, src/gnome-genius.c,
	  src/test.plugin.in:  Add a Hide= entry in the plugin description
	  and if true don't show the plugin in the gui.  Also if the
	  plugin menu is empty, then hide the whole toplevel menu.

Wed Jan 08 13:37:09 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/gnome-genius.c: move the helper program
	  to libexec

	* src/plugin.[ch], src/plug_api.h, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/gnome-genius.c, src/calc.c, src/plugread.[ch],
	  src/testplugin.c, src/genius.c: attempt to make the plugin
	  stuff a bit more usable and implement the save state and
	  restore state

	* src/calc.c, src/inter.c: use nicer colors on gui version

	* src/gnome-genius.c: fix saving of preferences, port the
	  error/info dialog to new gtk

	* src/eval.c, src/mpwrap.c, src/matrixw.c, src/lexer.l,
	  src/parse.y: fix warnings

	* configure.in: properly enable warnings

	  not really working

	* src/testplugin.c: implement some more functionality including
	  adding functions etc...

	* src/gnome-genius.c: some delete/bs fiddling, still not working
	  right for me though.  Also changed the logic for the fifo
	  creation

	* src/calc.c: fix plugin command to avoid an infinite input loop

Tue Jan 07 16:28:34 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: require vte since libzvt is broken and all that

	* src/calc.c: fix green color in help

	* src/genius-readline-helper.c, src/gnome-genius.c: port to vte
	  since libzvt is just giving me fits and we'll all use vte 
	  sooner or later

	* src/Makefile.am, src/gnome-genius.c: rename the readline helper

	  pivots 1 again

	* src/mpwrap.c: Fix two errors pointed out by Kai Arstila
	  <Kai.Arstila@Helsinki.FI>.  First fix rounding when first digit
	  is rounded.  Second fix arctan by using an implementation by
	  Guillermo Ballester Valor <gbv@oxixares.com> which I found on the
	  net.

Thu Dec 19 15:12:49 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.h, src/structs.h, src/eval.c, src/calc.c: start adding
	  some polynomial handling code.  Not much though.

Thu Dec 05 10:13:36 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel: add function for
	  eigenvalues, currently only for 2x2 and for triangular
	  matrices as special cases.

Sat Nov 23 10:13:15 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/*.gel: add RaleighQuotient, and reverse the

	* src/matrixw.c, src/mpwrap.c, src/plugin.c: Some leak hunting,
	  probably many leaks still left

Fri Nov 01 11:58:39 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/funclib.c: add a Combinations and Permutations function.  Also
	  fix checking for integers if complex numbers are passed

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel,
	  lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel:  Whack GAMMA (use Combinations name),
	  and fix some other naming, fix complex DotProduct add InnerProduct
	  alias, switch arguemnts on JordanBlock, add OuterProduct of
	  vectors, clean up norms to reduce it to 2 functions

	* src/eval.c, src/matop.[ch], src/structs.h: Implement basic modular
	  arithmetic.  Not currently too smart but usable for basic modulo
	  operations. 

Wed Oct 30 15:40:09 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: fix optimization of the matrix expansion for 1x1
	  matrices

Wed Oct 30 15:37:24 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  a matrix

	* src/dict.[ch], src/calc.c, src/eval.[ch], src/funclib.c,
	  src/compil.c, parseutil.c, structs.h:  don't do local variable
	  substitution on function nodes.  Rather push them onto a special
	  stack (this bit is ugly) and then add a special dictionary
	  to the function on context pop with the local vars.  This
	  should work a lot nicer then the replacing that was going on
	  before.

Wed Oct 30 11:27:40 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c, src/eval.[ch], src/funclib.c, src/lexer.l, src/parse.y,
	  src/matrixw.[ch], src/parseutil.[ch]:  Add the : operator like
	  matlab has and accept vectors rather then just ranges for indexes
	  of matrices.  Also add IndexComplement to the builtin functions

	* src/gnome-genius.c: minor cleanup

	* src/geniustest.pl, src/geniustests.txt: update test suite

	* lib/*/*.gel: update for the new syntax

Wed Oct 23 21:59:46 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  functions such as IsNormal and IsUnitary and such

Wed Oct 23 21:34:43 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel: some renaming add a nicer
	  Norm function (does LpNorm or L2Norm if no p specified)

Wed Oct 23 20:56:11 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/calc.c: whack restriction on desc string

	* src/matop.c, src/matrixw.c: Fix integer/rational caching

	* src/funclib.c: make gcd and lcm take multiple arguments or
	  a vector (or matrix).  Also rename PerfectSquare and PerfectPower
	  to IsPerfectSquare and IsPerfectPower

	* lib/number_theorey/*.gel: use the perfect functions above and
	  whack IsSquare

	* lib/linear_algebra/linear_algebra.gel: add some determinantal
	  divisor whackiness for integer matrices (less useful, but good
	  for homework/learning), a bunch of related nonsense too

	* lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel: add IsUpperTriangular,
	  IsLowerTriangular, and IsDiagonal

Wed Oct 23 16:49:40 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

Wed Oct 23 15:29:37 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/special_matrices.gel: add HilberMatrix,
	  and Henkel matrix and add some docs and fix Vandermonde matrix
	  and add vander alias

Wed Oct 23 14:33:56 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel: add support for Compound matrices and
	  the GAMMA set (may need renaming, all index combination vectors of,
	  for using in submatrices)

Wed Oct 23 13:41:49 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/*.gel: add some help strings and implement

Wed Oct 23 12:49:02 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* lib/linear_algebra/misc.gel: fix naming of adj.  Call it Adjugate
	  rather then Adjoint to avoid confusion

Wed Oct 23 12:29:10 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y, src/lexer.l, src/calc.[ch], src/funclib.c,
	  src/genius_lists.c, src/inter.c: remove the help function add a

	* src/funclib.c: set call can take a string

	* src/disc.c: fix global set

	* src/eval.[ch], src/parse.y, src/calc.c: allow passing of

	* Big fixing.  Basically apply the below patches to the 0.4.6 tree
	  remove the new context rewrite, fix a bunch of errors and crashes
	  and generally make the whole thing work.  Next up will be to
	  port it to gnome2 at some point though I think I might keep it
	  at gnome 1 level out of laziness.  I also fixed up all the
	  copyright notices.  I'm really keen on using genius again for my
	  homework/research and thus all this is happening.
	  Yay! Genius is not dead!

	  possible without a parser, but it should be ok for normal use
	  and only differs in functionality in cases of errors (or should)

1999-05-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: Check for termcap, then use -ltermcap in the
	readline check only if termcap was found (some readlines don't 
	require -ltermcap apparently)

	  least print something debuggable before making it right

	* eval.c: secondright is now copied, this fixes ifelse

	* lexer.l: fixed a bug in argument references during parse

	* eval.c: while doesn't check for a number (it does it's
	  own evaluation), but it still seems broken

Fri Jan 09 21:05:18 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: couple of minor changes, Ctrl-Q now also quits

	* eval.[ch]: added if,while and ifelse construct operations, also
	  reversed how branches returns the argument (it was wrong) and
	  made a function for telling which ones should get evaluated during
	  calculations (evalnode)

	* structs.h, eval.[ch]: added a secondright argument to primitives
	  since ifelse needs it

	* parse.y: added the parsing info for while,if,ifelse. lexer already
	  included it

	* eval.c: split up evalnode to several functions

	* README: updated

	* eval.h: took out an obscolete prototype

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.l: added comparison operators,
	  ==,!=,<=>,>,<,>=,<=

	* genius.c: ! taken out of the numpad, % put in

Fri Jan 09 16:17:38 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.c: fixed another bug in copynode, this fixes some segfaults,
	  and makes global functions work, local ones still segfault

	* eval.c: fixed a bug in evaluation, first evaluate left THEN
	  the right side. this caused trouble with separators and
	  function declarations

	* calc.c: the parse error message now says "before" instead of
	  "at" since it makes more sense

Fri Jan 09 02:08:11 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.l,dict.c: took function declaration from
	  parse time to execution time. Still segfaults all over the place

	* eval.c: fixed copynode, added function for adding fake function
	  nodes for declarations

Thu Jan 08 00:11:22 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* README: updated to reflect the changes

	* COPYING: added

	* genius.c: make floats ints is now disabled by default as
	  it is not too intuitive, meaning it might not do what a user
	  expects

Wed Jan 07 23:44:13 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* dict.[ch]: addfunc now returns a pointer to the actual created
	  record

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.y: added a separator primitive, all it does is
	  right side. meaning you can have more expressions after each other
	  and taht will return the value of the last one

	* dict.[ch]: created dictionary contexts so that local
	  variables/functions are possible

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.y,funclib.c: added user function support, not
	  yet completely finished, but it is working quite nicely already,
	  recursion does not yet work and I know what's the problem and will
	  fix it, though there are not yet any structures for programming,
	  there are many MANY small changes around these files to support this

Tue Jan 06 18:38:17 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch],parse.y: added mod ('%') operator

Tue Jan 06 15:38:49 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: Make use of the app widget, get rid of buttons in favor of
	  menus, use gnome_init instead of gtk_init, add #include <gnome.h>

Mon Jan 05 23:14:56 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.c,calc.c,structs.h: changed some tree_t internals to
	  match the new constant names

	* eval.c,struct.c: it should be now possible to evaluate user
	  which are just compiled into evaluation trees

	* util.[ch]: took out makelc

	* dict.[ch]: made searches case sensitive and added support for
	  user functions

	* lexer.l,parser.y: added support for no-argument user functions
	  (variables) setting

	* calc.c: fixed a bug so that the builtin functions don't get
	  added again and again

	* eval.[ch]: added the '=' operation and changed evalexp to be able
	  to set variables

Sun Jan 04 23:50:25 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: accelerator stuff revamped, and all is done through
	  the keypress event, nothing will happen on empty string

Sun Jan 04 22:59:28 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: Got the keybindings to work, so it can be completely
	  keyboard driven. ^C quits \n runs calculations.

Sun Jan 04 20:57:01 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.[ch],eval.c,genius.c: implemented calcstate structure,
	  instead of separate variables

	* genius.c: added some options for the new calcstate structure
	  these are the make results floats and scientific notation

	* calc.c: if the number of digits is reduced the number is now
	  rounded, implemented scientific notation, implemented conversion
	  to floats, some cleanup, a typo fixed

	* lexer.l: can now read integers in scientific notation as
	  floats

	* structs.h,calc.c,eval.c: changed some enum constants' names to
	  be more meaningful

	* dict.c: small typo to make builtin functions

	* eval.c: some cleanup, reduced the number of temporaries used in
	  some operations, put switch statements in the code instead of
	  some if/else structures

	* mymath.c: mympf_pow_ui now safely works when rop and op are one
	  and the same number (it will still not use a temp when the numbers
	  are in fact different)

Sat Jan 03 16:57:17 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.c, eval.c: it's possible to have functions in uncomputed
	  expressions, they will display properly

	* funclib.[ch]: deleted test_op ("test" function), added functions
	  "cos", "tan", "pi", "e"

	* mymath.[ch]: created these files for some helper gmp functions

	* eval.c: taken out mympf_pow_ui and put it into mymath.[ch]
	  added an ugly ans slow temporary way to do exponentials of
	  floats, it converts it to a rational first

Sat Jan 03 12:48:31 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.[ch]: deleted old unused functions, added prototypes
	  to genius.h, added errorreporting functions

	* calc.c, eval.c: now use the error reporting function

Sat Jan 03 02:18:55 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch], calc.c, parse.y: the stack is now a structure of type
	  evalstack_t, it's a dynamic array now

	* eval.c: added #include "util.h"

	* util.c: made my_realloc safer

	* funclib.c: added #include <gmp.h>

	* funclib.[ch]: sine function added ("sin"), works only for -pi<x<pi

Sat Jan 03 00:37:52 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* util.c: proper casting in makelc

	* dict.c: makebifunc now doesn't segfault.

	* dict.c: d_addfunc fixed, it adds dictinary entries now

	* eval.c: added NULL checking to freetree and freetree now does
	  freeargs, not freenode and makefuncd sets n->left and right to
	  NULL ... that made ugly segfaults

	* eval.c: evalnode now evaluates function args correctly

Fri Jan 02 21:21:27 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.h: removed FACTORIAL_ERROR since it's not a fatal error

	* eval.c: Should be able to run functions from funclib

	* funclib.[ch]: removed funclib_exec function since that's
	  obscolete, added addall and test_op functions and there's a
	  "test" function returns sum of three arguments (no typechecking
	  is done and they have to be integers! it's just a testroutine)

	* calc.c: added #include "funclib.h", and it will add all the
	  funclib functions the first time evalexpr is run.
