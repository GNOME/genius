1. Introduction
---------------

LAPACK  is a  library  of Fortran  90  with subroutines  for
solving  the most commonly  occurring problems  in numerical
linear  algebra.  It  is freely-available  software,  and is
copyrighted.

  This  distribution  repackages  the  original  LAPACK  and
LAPACKE source code under the configuration and installation
framework  provided  by  the  GNU Autotools.   It  was  last
updated with LAPACK 3.4.0.

  ATLAPACK expects a BLAS library to be already installed on
the system;  when no optimised  library is available,  it is
suggested  to  use the  ATBLAS  distribution (see  Resources
below).

3. Install
----------

Do this:

    $ cd atlapack-0.1.0
    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ cd "=build"

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The Makefile supports  the DESTDIR environment variable to
install files in a  temporary location, example: to see what
will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/atlapack

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/atlapack


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation.
