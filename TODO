-- document new things in 1.0.7 -- FIXME: DID WE?



* Decimal arithmetic
* Logfiles and/or save session
* Whack the readline nonsense in the GUI
* Native polynomial operation
* Add continued fraction type of a loop
* Add user argument checking functions for parameters (to make calling GEL
  functions that check their arguments faster)
* fix matrix exp function and add matrix ln function
* matrix powers for rational numbers, and scalar^matrix (as matlab does it)
* Graph of 1/x or atan must not have vertical lines.  Futhermore maybe we
  should perhaps think about removing the vertical line if two consecutive
  points are much further from each other than the previous two points on the
  graph.  This would graph the step function correctly.
* Implement max_nodes in the command line version
  * Implement MaxNodes parameter
* Kill plugin interface maybe?  It is just a pain to maintain and no one uses 
  AFAIK.  It was originally done to make Dr.Genius possible, but that's long
  over.


Possibly old
------------

* Check this strange thing of locals living on the global context somehow,
  try the testprogfamily.gel and look at vars and notice there are things
  with context > 0 on the toplevel context.   It's strange.  And I can't
  repro it now

This is out of date
-------------------

*	Gauss needs to be mod aware (isn't it now?)

*	Check variable substitution of references, that could refer
	to freed data I think

*	Check rational powers in mod mode to work correctly

*	Check modular arithmetic to be correct (such as: "expr mod n"),
        that is, when do we mod is the question.

*	Perhaps latex and troff mode should not be used on error output,
	only on toplevel.  Alternantively everything should be latex/troffized
	I suppose.  I like the first alternative more though.

*	add try/catch operator for exceptions (need special exception
	variable like return_val)

*	interrupt internal mpwrap calculation (need new error type)

*	cleanup engine

*	make one line expression output more sane and make it work right
	for matricies

*	more calculator functions for use in plugins etc

*	add interface for using guile inside genius (or maybe not)
