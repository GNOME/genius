* What is VTE?

VTE is a library (libvte) implementing a terminal emulator widget for GTK+,
and a minimal sample application (vte) using that.  Vte is mainly used in
gnome-terminal, but can also be used to embed a console/terminal in games,
editors, IDEs, etc.

VTE supports Unicode and character set conversion, as well as emulating any
terminal known to the system's terminfo database.

VTE doesn't have a homepage.  Report any issues at:
