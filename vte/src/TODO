Remove VteTerminalPrivate:char_{a,de}scent

Handle display changes for cursors! (vte_terminal_set_cursor_from_regex_match is buggy then)
Maybe rename vte_terminal_feed_child to make utf-8 clear
use guint8 instead char in vte_terminal_feed_child_binary?
VteBufferClass::commit size param -> gsize! (also in class_init: gtype!)
::commit make TYPE_POINTER to avoid the string copy?
VteBufferClass etc: add padding!!!
support passing child_pid = -1 to remove the wathch in vte_buffer_watch_child
add default handlers for Vtebuffer:move-window and :resize-window to VteView ?
add default handlers for VteView:{in,de}crease-font-size ?
VteScreen:scroll_delta -> move to vteview ??
add freeze/unfreeze vtebuffer methods (to use while selecting, saving, etc)
difference between default_row/column_count and row/column_count in Vtebufferprivate?
remove vte_buffer_refresh_size calls from get_Preferred_width/height!
make Vteview able to view just a subrect of the grid of vtebuffer (replace buffer->column/row_count by terminal ones?)
maybe replace word-chars with a regex?
replace vte_conv with VTE_CONV_GUNICHAR_TYPE to/from UTF-8 with g_utf8_to_ucs4/g_ucs4_to_utf8
[re]do stuff from realize/size-allocate when buffer is set!
make vtebuffer implement ginitable (ring_ini can fail!)
vtebufferiter: is it global, or should it store the VteScreen too? + vte_view_match_check_iter: what if the iter points to a different screen thatn the one currently shown?
make vte_view_match_check* return a GMatchInfo instead (depends on glib bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=653005)
add freeze/thaw to vtebuffer
rename VteBufferIter -> VteBufferMark to match gtktextview stuff?
add vte_view_freeze/thaw_scroll ? to temporarily inhibit scroll-to-end on keystroke/output
use AtkText:text-insterted/changed/removed instead of text-changed (see bug atk #638377)
move gtk-doc vte-docs.xml etc from GFDL to simply GPL 3+ ?
get-goemetry-hints arg order (out last), and also add maybe (inout) flags?
hide VteBuffer public struct, extending it is not really possible anyway, and then remove ->priv
VteProcess to abstract around g_spawn_async() (and for running task notification & question on tab close in g-t?)

hard: move from GIOChannel to GIOStream, process IO on a worker thread, make buffer abstract and move pty stuff up into a derived VtePtyBuffer class
