The setup is similar to the previous.  You should run

./update-po.sh LANG

to update your langauge (where LANG is the language code).  That updates the
.po file for translations.

The whole thing is translated into HTML which are stored in git, so that we
don't depend on docbook stuff to build.

./update-xml-to-txt-html.sh
Does all the conversions and so on, and also runs ./make-makefile-am.sh.
Really does not need to be run often, really only before distribution I'd say.
No need to continually update the html files.  This needs to be updated when a
new language is added: the LANGS="" at the top of the file.

./make-makefile-am.sh
Since automake is dumb and can't handle having files that I can't predict in
the distribution.  This needs to be updated when a new language is added: the
LANGS="" at the top of the file.

To add a new language you just add the subdirectory, generate a .po file from
genius.xml with itstool then add the directory language to the two scripts
above.  If you add figures, just add the figures subdirectory and the figures
with same file names as the C ones in there.  The script above will take care
of adding them to the Makefile.am.

The genius.txt is just autogenerated, and not really used much, it's really
just a backup, don't worry about it.
