<!-- ============= Introduction =============================== -->
  <chapter id="genius-introduction"> 
    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <para>
	The &app; application is a general calculator for use as a desktop
        calculator, an educational tool in mathematics and other STEM fields,
	and has found use in research.  The language used in &app; is designed to be
	&lsquo;mathematical&rsquo; in the sense that it should be &lsquo;what
	you mean is what you get&rsquo;.  Of course, that is not an
	entirely attainable goal.  &app; features rationals, arbitrary
	precision integers and multiple precision floats using the GMP library.
	It handles complex numbers using cartesian notation.  It has good
	vector and matrix manipulation and can handle basic linear algebra.
	The programming language allows user defined functions, variables, and
	parameters.
    </para> 

    <para>
	&app; comes in two versions.  One version is the graphical GNOME
	version, which features an IDE style interface and the ability 
	to plot functions of one or two variables.  Parametric plots of curves
	are also supported.  It can plot slope fields,
	vector fields and draw their solutions.  The plots can be exported
	to several formats.
	The command line version does not require GNOME, but
	does not implement any feature that requires the graphical interface,
	such as plotting
    </para> 

    <para>
	    Parts of this manual describe the graphical version of the calculator.
	    The language that both versions use is the same, it is simply the
	    graphical features such as plotting that are unique to the GUI version.
    </para>

    <para>
	    Generally, when some feature of the language (function, operator, etc...)
	    is new in some version past 1.0.5, it is mentioned, but
	    below 1.0.5 you would have to look at the NEWS file.

    <title>Basic Usage</title> 

    <sect1 id="genius-usage-workarea"> 
      <title>Using the Work Area</title> 

      <para>
        Normally you interact with the calculator in the <guilabel>Console</guilabel> tab of the
	work area.  If you are running the text only version then the console
	will be the only thing that is available to you.  If you want to use
	&app; as a calculator only, just type in your expression in the console, it
	will be evaluated, and the returned value will be printed.
      </para>

      <para>
	      To evaluate an expression, type it into the <guilabel>Console</guilabel> work area and press enter.
	      Expressions are written in a
language called GEL.  The most simple GEL expressions just looks like
mathematics.  For example
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>30*70 + 67^3.0 + ln(7) * (88.8/100)</userinput>
</screen>
or
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>62734 + 812634 + 77^4 mod 5</userinput>
</screen>
or
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>| sin(37) - e^7 |</userinput>
</screen>
or
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>sum n=1 to 70 do 1/n</userinput>
</screen>
(Last is the harmonic sum from 1 to 70)
</para>
<para>
To get a list of functions and commands, type:
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>help</userinput>
</screen>
If you wish to get more help on a specific function, type:
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>help FunctionName</userinput>
</screen>
To view this manual, type:
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>manual</userinput>
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Suppose you have previously saved some GEL commands as a program to a file and
you now want to execute them.
To load this program from the file <filename>path/to/program.gel</filename>,
type
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>load path/to/program.gel</userinput>
</screen>
&app; keeps track of the current directory.
To list files in the current directory type <command>ls</command>, to change directory
do <userinput>cd directory</userinput> as in the UNIX command shell.
</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="genius-usage-create-program"> 
      <title>To Create a New Program </title> 
      <para>
	      If you wish to enter several more complicated commands, or perhaps write a complicated
	      function using the <link linkend="genius-gel">GEL</link> language, you can create a new
	     program; really just a file with many commands.
      </para>
      <para>
To start writing a new program, choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New
Program</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. A new tab will appear in the work area. You
can write a <link linkend="genius-gel">GEL</link> program in this work area.
Once you have written your program you can run it by 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Calculator</guimenu><guimenuitem>Run</guimenuitem></menuchoice> (or
the <guilabel>Run</guilabel> toolbar button).
This will execute your program and will display any output on the <guilabel>Console</guilabel> tab.
Executing a program is equivalent of taking the text of the program and
typing it into the console.  The only difference is that this input is done
independent of the console and just the output goes onto the console.
<menuchoice><guimenu>Calculator</guimenu><guimenuitem>Run</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
will always run the currently selected program even if you are on the <guilabel>Console</guilabel>
tab.  The currently selected program has its tab in bold type.  To select a
program, just click on its tab.
      </para>
      <para>
To save the program you've just written, choose <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
Similarly as in other programs you can choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to save a program that already has
a filename attached to it.  If you have many opened programs you have edited and wish to save you can also choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save All Unsaved</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
      </para>
      <para>
	      Programs that have unsaved changes will have a "[+]" next to their filename.  This way you can see if the file
	      on disk and the currently opened tab differ in content.  Programs which have not yet had a filename associated
	      with them are always considered unsaved and no "[+]" is printed.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="genius-usage-open-program"> 
      <title>To Open and Run a Program </title> 
      <para>
To open a file, choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
A new tab containing the file will appear in the work area. You can use this to
edit the file.
      </para>
      <para>
To run a program from a file, choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Load and
Run...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.  This will run the program without opening it
in a separate tab.  This is equivalent to the <command>load</command> command.
      </para>
      <para>
	      If you have made edits to a file you wish to throw away and want to reload to the version that's on disk,
	      you can choose the
	      <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Reload from Disk</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menuitem.  This is useful for experimenting
	      with a program and making temporary edits, to run a program, but that you do not intend to keep.
      </para>

  <!-- ============= Plotting ============================== -->
  <chapter id="genius-gel-plotting">
    <title>Plotting</title>

    <para>
      Plotting support is only available in the graphical GNOME version.
      All plotting accessible from the graphical interface is available from
      the <guilabel>Create Plot</guilabel> window.  You can access this window by either clicking
      on the <guilabel>Plot</guilabel> button on the toolbar or selecting <guilabel>Plot</guilabel> from the <guilabel>Calculator</guilabel>
      menu.  You can also access the plotting functionality by using the
      <link linkend="genius-gel-function-list-plotting">plotting
      functions</link> of the GEL language.  See 
      <xref linkend="genius-gel"/> to find out how to
      enter expressions that &appname; understands.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="genius-line-plots">
      <title>Line Plots</title>
      <para>
	To graph real-valued functions of one variable, open the <guilabel>Create Plot</guilabel>
	window.  You can also use the
        <link linkend="gel-function-LinePlot"><function>LinePlot</function></link> function
	on the command line (see its documentation).  And by the words line plot, we mean plots in the plane,
	as opposed to surface plots, which are in three dimensions.
      </para>
      <para>
	Once you click the <guilabel>Plot</guilabel> button, a window opens up with some notebooks in it.
	You want to be in the <guilabel>Function line plot</guilabel> notebook
tab, and inside you want to be on the <guilabel>Functions / Expressions</guilabel> notebook tab.
See <xref linkend="lineplot-fig"/>.

      <para>
	Type expressions with <userinput>x</userinput> as
	the independent variable into the textboxes.  Alternatively you can give names of functions such as
	<userinput>cos</userinput> rather then having to type <userinput>cos(x)</userinput>.
	You can graph up to ten functions.  If you make a mistake and &appname; cannot
	parse the input it will signify this with a warning icon on the right of the text
	input box where the error occurred, as well as giving you an error dialog.
	You can change the ranges of the dependent and independent variables in the bottom
	part of the dialog.  In the boxes for the ranges, simple expressions are allowed,
	such as <userinput>2*pi</userinput> or <userinput>10^3</userinput>.
	The <varname>y</varname> (dependent) range can be set automatically by turning on the <guilabel>Fit dependent axis</guilabel>
	checkbox.
	The names of the variables can also be changed.
	Pressing the <guilabel>Plot</guilabel> button produces the graph shown in <xref linkend="lineplot2-fig"/>.
      </para>
      <para>

  <!-- ============= GEL ====================================== -->
  <chapter id="genius-gel"> 
    <title>GEL Basics</title> 

	<para>
	  GEL stands for Genius Extension Language.  <!-- Alternatively it also
	  stands for George's Ego Leverage. -->  It is the language you use
	  to write programs in &appname;. A program in GEL is simply an
	  expression that evaluates to a number, a matrix, or another object
	  in GEL.
	  &app; can be used as a simple calculator, or as a
	  powerful theoretical research tool.  The syntax is meant to
	  have as shallow of a learning curve as possible, especially for use
	  as a calculator.
	</para>

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-values">
      <title>Values</title>

      <para>
	      Values in GEL can be <link linkend="genius-gel-values-numbers">numbers</link>, <link linkend="genius-gel-values-booleans">Booleans</link>, or <link linkend="genius-gel-values-strings">strings</link>.   GEL also treats 
<link linkend="genius-gel-matrices">matrices</link> as values.
	      Values can be used in calculations, assigned to variables and returned from functions, among other uses.
      </para>

      <sect2 id="genius-gel-values-numbers">
        <title>Numbers</title>
        <para>
Integers are the first type of number in GEL. Integers are written in the normal way.
<programlisting>1234
</programlisting>
Hexadecimal and octal numbers can be written using C notation. For example:
<programlisting>0x123ABC
01234
</programlisting>
Or you can type numbers in an arbitrary base using <literal>&lt;base&gt;\&lt;number&gt;</literal>. Digits higher than 10 use letters in a similar way to hexadecimal. For example, a number in base 23 could be written:
<programlisting>23\1234ABCD
</programlisting>
        </para>

        <para>
The second type of GEL number is rationals. Rationals are simply achieved by dividing two integers. So one could write:
<programlisting>3/4
</programlisting>
to get three quarters. Rationals also accept mixed fraction notation. So in order to get one and three tenths you could write:
<programlisting>1 3/10
</programlisting>
        </para>

        <para>
The next type of number is floating point. These are entered in a similar fashion to C notation. You can use <literal>E</literal>, <literal>e</literal> or <literal>@</literal> as the exponent delimiter. Note that using the exponent delimiter gives a float even if there is no decimal point in the number. Examples:
<programlisting>1.315
7.887e77
7.887e-77
.3
0.3
77e5
</programlisting>
	When &appname; prints a floating point number it will always append a
	<computeroutput>.0</computeroutput> even if the number is whole.  This is to indicate that
	floating point numbers are taken as imprecise quantities.  When a number is written in the
	scientific notation, it is always a floating point number and thus &appname; does not
	print the <computeroutput>.0</computeroutput>.
        </para>

        <para>
The final type of number in GEL is the complex numbers. You can enter a complex number as a sum of real and imaginary parts. To add an imaginary part, append an <literal>i</literal>.  Here are examples of entering complex numbers:
<programlisting>1+2i
8.01i
77*e^(1.3i)
</programlisting>
        </para>

        <important>
          <para>
When entering imaginary numbers, a number must be in front of the <literal>i</literal>. If you use <literal>i</literal> by itself, &appname; will interpret this as referring to the variable <varname>i</varname>. If you need to refer to <literal>i</literal> by itself, use <literal>1i</literal> instead.
          </para>

          <para>
In order to use mixed fraction notation with imaginary numbers you must have the mixed fraction in parentheses. (i.e., <userinput>(1 2/5)i</userinput>)
          </para>
        </important>

      </sect2>


      <sect2 id="genius-gel-values-booleans">
        <title>Booleans</title>
        <para>
&appname; also supports native Boolean values. The two Boolean constants are
defined as <constant>true</constant> and <constant>false</constant>; these
identifiers can be used like any other variable. You can also use the
identifiers <constant>True</constant>, <constant>TRUE</constant>,
<constant>False</constant> and <constant>FALSE</constant> as aliases for the
above.
        </para>
        <para>
At any place where a Boolean expression is expected, you can use a Boolean
value or any expression that produces either a number or a Boolean. If
&appname; needs to evaluate a number as a Boolean it will interpret
0 as <constant>false</constant> and any other number as
<constant>true</constant>.
         </para>
        <para>
In addition, you can do arithmetic with Boolean values. For example:
<programlisting>( (1 + true) - false ) * true
</programlisting>
is the same as:
<programlisting>( (true or true) or not false ) and true
</programlisting>
Only addition, subtraction and multiplication are supported. If you mix numbers with Booleans in an expression then the numbers are converted to Booleans as described above. This means that, for example:
<programlisting>1 == true
</programlisting>
always evaluates to <constant>true</constant> since 1 will be converted to <constant>true</constant> before being compared to <constant>true</constant>.
        </para>
      </sect2>


      <sect2 id="genius-gel-values-strings">
        <title>Strings</title>
        <para>
Like numbers and Booleans, strings in GEL can be stored as values inside variables and passed to functions. You can also concatenate a string with another value using the plus operator. For example:
<programlisting>a=2+3;"The result is: "+a
</programlisting>
will create the string:
<programlisting>The result is: 5
</programlisting>
You can also use C-like escape sequences such as <literal>\n</literal>,<literal>\t</literal>,<literal>\b</literal>,<literal>\a</literal> and <literal>\r</literal>. To get a <literal>\</literal> or <literal>"</literal> into the string you can quote it with a <literal>\</literal>. For example:
<programlisting>"Slash: \\ Quotes: \" Tabs: \t1\t2\t3"
</programlisting>
will make a string:
<programlisting>Slash: \ Quotes: " Tabs: 	1	2	3
</programlisting>
Do note however that when a string is returned from a function, escapes are
quoted, so that the output can be used as input.  If you wish to print the
string as it is (without escapes), use the 
<link linkend="gel-function-print"><function>print</function></link>
or
<link linkend="gel-function-printn"><function>printn</function></link> functions.
        </para>
        <para>
		In addition, you can use the library function <link linkend="gel-function-string"><function>string</function></link> to convert anything to a string. For example:
<programlisting>string(22)
</programlisting>
will return
<programlisting>"22"
</programlisting>
Strings can also be compared with <literal>==</literal> (equal), <literal>!=</literal> (not equal) and <literal>&lt;=&gt;</literal> (comparison) operators
        </para>
      </sect2>


      <sect2 id="genius-gel-values-null">
        <title>Null</title>
        <para>
There is a special value called
<constant>null</constant>. No operations can be performed on
it, and nothing is printed when it is returned. Therefore,
<constant>null</constant> is useful when you do not want output from an
expression.  The value <constant>null</constant> can be obtained as an expression when you
type <literal>.</literal>, the constant <constant>null</constant> or nothing.
By nothing we mean that if you end an expression with
a separator <literal>;</literal>, it is equivalent to ending it with a
separator followed by a <constant>null</constant>.
        </para>
        <para>
Example:
<programlisting>x=5;.
x=5;
</programlisting>
        </para>
<para>
Some functions return <constant>null</constant> when no value can be returned
or an error happened.  Also <constant>null</constant> is used as an empty vector
or matrix, or an empty reference.

        </para>

        <para>
To assign a value to a variable, use the <literal>=</literal> or <literal>:=</literal> operators. These operators set the value of the variable and return the value you set, so you can do things like
<programlisting>a = b = 5
</programlisting>
This will set <varname>b</varname> to 5 and then also set <varname>a</varname> to 5.
        </para>

        <para>
The <literal>=</literal> and <literal>:=</literal> operators can both be used to set variables. The difference between them is that the <literal>:=</literal> operator always acts as an assignment operator, whereas the <literal>=</literal> operator may be interpreted as testing for equality when used in a context where a Boolean expression is expected.

If you include <literal>...</literal> after the last argument name in the function declaration, then &appname; will allow any number of arguments to be passed in place of that argument. If no arguments were passed then that argument will be set to <constant>null</constant>. Otherwise, it will be a horizontal vector containing all the arguments. For example:
<programlisting>function f(a,b...) = b
</programlisting>
Then <userinput>f(1,2,3)</userinput> yields <computeroutput>[2,3]</computeroutput>, while <userinput>f(1)</userinput> yields a <constant>null</constant>.

        <title>Passing Functions to Functions</title>

        <para>
In &appname;, it is possible to pass a function as an argument to another function. This can be done using either &lsquo;function nodes&rsquo; or anonymous functions.
        </para>

        <para>
If you do not enter the parentheses after a function name, instead of being evaluated, the function will instead be returned as a &lsquo;function node&rsquo;. The function node can then be passed to another function.
Example:
<programlisting>function f(a,b) = a(b)+1;
function b(x) = x*x;
f(b,2)
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
To pass functions that are not defined,
you can use an anonymous function (see <xref linkend="genius-gel-functions-defining" />).  That is, you want to pass a function without giving it a name.
Syntax:
<programlisting><![CDATA[function(<comma separated arguments>) = <function body>
`(<comma separated arguments>) = <function body>
]]></programlisting>
Example:
<programlisting>function f(a,b) = a(b)+1;
f(`(x) = x*x,2)
</programlisting>
This will return 5.

    <sect2 id="genius-gel-functions-operations">
      <title>Operations on Functions</title>
      <para>
	      Some functions allow arithmetic operations, and some single argument functions such as <link linkend="gel-function-exp"><function>exp</function></link> or <link linkend="gel-function-ln"><function>ln</function></link>, to operate on the function. For example,
<programlisting>exp(sin*cos+4)
</programlisting>
will return a function that takes <varname>x</varname> and returns <userinput>exp(sin(x)*cos(x)+4)</userinput>.  It is functionally equivalent
to typing
<programlisting>`(x) = exp(sin(x)*cos(x)+4)
</programlisting>

This operation can be useful when quickly defining functions. For example to create a function called <varname>f</varname>
to perform the above operation, you can just type:
<programlisting>f = exp(sin*cos+4)
</programlisting>
It can also be used in plotting. For example, to plot sin squared you can enter:
<programlisting>LinePlot(sin^2)
</programlisting>
      </para>

      <warning>
        <para>
Not all functions can be used in this way.  For example, when you use a binary operation the functions must take the same number of arguments.

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-separator">
      <title>Separator</title>
      <para>
	      GEL is somewhat different from other languages in how it deals with multiple commands and functions.
	      In GEL you must chain commands together with a separator operator.
That is, if you want to type more than one expression you have to use
the <literal>;</literal> operator in between the expressions.   This is
a way in which both expressions are evaluated and the result of the second one (or the last one
if there is more than two expressions) is returned.
Suppose you type the following:
<programlisting>3 ; 5
</programlisting>
This expression will yield 5.
      </para>
      <para>
This will require some parenthesizing to make it unambiguous sometimes,
especially if the <literal>;</literal> is not the top most primitive. This slightly differs from
other programming languages where the <literal>;</literal> is a terminator of statements, whereas
in GEL it&rsquo;s actually a binary operator. If you are familiar with pascal
this should be second nature. However genius can let you pretend it is a
terminator to some degree.  If a <literal>;</literal> is found at the end of a parenthesis or a block,
genius will append a null to it as if you would have written
<userinput>;null</userinput>.
This is useful in case you do not want to return a value from a loop,
or if you handle the return differently.
      </para>
      <para>
	      If you are typing expressions in a program file you do not have to add a semicolon.  In this case
	      genius will simply print the return value whenever it executes the expression.  This is the same
	      as when typing on the command line.  However, do note that if you are defining a
	      function, the body of the function is a single expression.  Usually, therefore, if a function body is
	      long, you will need to enclose it in parentheses.

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-comments">
      <title>Comments</title>
      <para>
	      GEL is similar to other scripting languages in that <literal>#</literal> denotes
	      a comment, that is text that is not meant to be evaluated.  Everything beyond the
	      pound sign till the end of line will just be ignored.  For example,
<programlisting># This is just a comment
# every line in a comment must have its own pound sign
# in the next line we set x to the value 123
x=123;
</programlisting>
      </para>

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-modular-evaluation">
      <title>Modular Evaluation</title>
      <para>
	      &appname; implements modular arithmetic.
To use it you just add "mod &lt;integer&gt;" after
the expression.  Example:
<userinput>2^(5!) * 3^(6!) mod 5</userinput>
It could be possible to do modular arithmetic by computing with integers and then modding in the end with
the <literal>%</literal> operator, which simply gives the remainder, but
that may be time consuming if not impossible when working with larger numbers.
For example, <userinput>10^(10^10) % 6</userinput> will simply not work (the exponent
will be too large), while
<userinput>10^(10^10) mod 6</userinput> is instantaneous.  The first expression first tries to compute the integer
<userinput>10^(10^10)</userinput> and then find remainder after division by 6, while the second expression evaluates
everything modulo 6 to begin with.
      </para>
      <para>
	      The inverses of numbers mod some integer are computed by writing them as
rational numbers (as long as the desired inverse exists, of course).
Examples:
<programlisting>10^-1 mod 101
1/10 mod 101</programlisting>
Modular evaluation also works with matrices including taking inverses,
powers, and dividing.
Example:
<programlisting>A = [1,2;3,4]
B = A^-1 mod 5
A*B mod 5</programlisting>
This should yield the identity matrix as B will be the inverse of A mod 5.
      </para>
      <para>
Some functions such as
<link linkend='gel-function-sqrt'><function>sqrt</function></link> or
<link linkend='gel-function-log'><function>log</function></link>
work in a different way when in modulo mode.  These will then work like their
discrete versions working within the ring of integers you selected.  For
example:
<programlisting>genius> sqrt(4) mod 7
=
[2, 5]
genius> 2*2 mod 7
= 4</programlisting>
	<function>sqrt</function> will actually return all the possible square
	roots.
      </para>
      <para>
	      Do not chain mod operators, simply place it at the end of the computation, all computations in the expression on the left
	      will be carried out in mod arithmetic.  If you place a mod inside
	      a mod, you will get unexpected results.  If you simply want to
	      mod a single number and control exactly when remainders are
	      taken, best to use the <literal>%</literal> operator.  When you
	      need to chain several expressions in modular arithmetic with
	      different divisors, it may be best to just split up the expression into several and use
	      temporary variables to avoid a mod inside a mod.

	   <para>
	     When the numbers involved are floating point numbers, for example
	     <userinput>1.0:0.4:3.0</userinput>, the output is what is expected
	     even though adding 0.4 to 1.0 five times is actually just slightly
	     more than 3.0 due to the way that floating point numbers are
	     stored in base 2 (there is no 0.4, the actual number stored is
	     just ever so slightly bigger).  The way this is handled is the
	     same as in the for, sum, and prod loops.  If the end is within
	     <userinput>2^-20</userinput> times the step size of the endpoint,
	     the endpoint is used and we assume there were roundoff errors.
	     This is not perfect, but it handles the majority of the cases.
	     This check is done only from version 1.0.18 onwards, so execution
	     of your code may differ on older versions.  If you want to avoid
	     dealing with this issue, use actual rational numbers, possibly
	     using the <function>float</function> if you wish to get floating
	     point numbers in the end.  For example
	     <userinput>1:2/5:3</userinput> does the right thing and
	     <userinput>float(1:2/5:3)</userinput> even gives you floating
	     point numbers and is ever so slightly more precise than
	     <userinput>1.0:0.4:3.0</userinput>.

<note>
<para>
The @() operator makes the : operator most useful.  With this you can specify regions of a matrix.  So that a@(2:4,6) is the rows 2,3,4 of the column 6. Or a@(,1:2) will get you the first two columns of a matrix. You can also assign to the @() operator, as long as the right value is a matrix that matches the region in size, or if it is any other type of value.
</para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
The comparison operators (except for the &lt;=&gt; operator, which behaves normally), are not strictly binary operators, they can in fact be grouped in the normal mathematical way, e.g.: (1&lt;x&lt;=y&lt;5) is a legal boolean expression and means just what it should, that is (1&lt;x and x&le;y and y&lt;5)
</para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
The unitary minus operates in a different fashion depending on where it
appears.  If it appears before a number it binds very closely, if it appears in
front of an expression it binds less than the power and factorial operators.
So for example <userinput>-1^k</userinput> is really <userinput>(-1)^k</userinput>,
but <userinput>-foo(1)^k</userinput> is really <userinput>-(foo(1)^k)</userinput>.  So
be careful how you use it and if in doubt, add parentheses.

Syntax:
<programlisting><![CDATA[if <expression1> then <expression2> [else <expression3>]

If <literal>else</literal> is omitted, then if the <literal>expression1</literal> yields <constant>false</constant> or 0, <literal>NULL</literal> is returned.

Note that <literal>=</literal> will be translated to <literal>==</literal> if used inside the expression for <literal>if</literal>, so

until <expression1> do <expression2>
do <expression2> while <expression1>
do <expression2> until <expression1>]]></programlisting>

	These are similar to other languages.  However, as in GEL it is simply an expression that must have some return value, these
	constructs will simply return the result of the last iteration or <literal>NULL</literal> if no iteration was done.  In the boolean expression, <literal>=</literal> is translated into <literal>==</literal> just as for the <literal>if</literal> statement.

Syntax:
<programlisting><![CDATA[for <identifier> = <from> to <to> do <body>
for <identifier> = <from> to <to> by <increment> do <body>]]></programlisting>

Loop with identifier being set to all values from <literal>&lt;from&gt;</literal> to <literal>&lt;to&gt;</literal>, optionally using an increment other than 1. These are faster, nicer and more compact than the normal loops such as above, but less flexible. The identifier must be an identifier and can't be a dereference. The value of identifier is the last value of identifier, or <literal>&lt;from&gt;</literal> if body was never evaluated. The variable is guaranteed to be initialized after a loop, so you can safely use it.  Also the <literal>&lt;from&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;to&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;increment&gt;</literal> must be non complex values. The <literal>&lt;to&gt;</literal> is not guaranteed to be hit, but will never be overshot, for example the following prints out odd numbers from 1 to 19:
<programlisting>for i = 1 to 20 by 2 do print(i)
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
		When one of the values is a floating point number, then the
		final check is done to within 2^-20 of the step size.  That is,
		even if we overshoot by 2^-20 times the "by" above, we still execute the last
		iteration.  This way 
<programlisting>for x = 0 to 1 by 0.1 do print(x)
</programlisting>
does the expected even though adding 0.1 ten times becomes just slightly more than 1.0 due to the way that floating point numbers
are stored in base 2 (there is no 0.1, the actual number stored is just ever so slightly bigger).  This is not perfect but it handles
the majority of the cases.  If you want to avoid dealing with this issue, use actual rational numbers for example:
<programlisting>for x = 0 to 1 by 1/10 do print(x)
</programlisting>
		This check is done only from version 1.0.16 onwards, so execution of your code may differ on older versions.

			For each element in the matrix, going row by row from left to right we execute the body

print numbers 1,2,3 and 4 in this order you could do:
<programlisting>for n in [1,2:3,4] do print(n)
</programlisting>
If you wish to run through the rows and columns of a matrix, you can use
the RowsOf and ColumnsOf functions, which return a vector of the rows or

<programlisting>for n in RowsOf ([1,2:3,4]) do print(n)

You can also use the <literal>break</literal> and <literal>continue</literal> commands in loops. The continue <literal>continue</literal> command will restart the current loop at its next iteration, while the <literal>break</literal> command exits the current loop.

	The following standard comparison operators are supported in GEL and have the obvious meaning:

	<literal>&lt;=</literal>, <literal>!=</literal>,
	<literal>&lt;&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;</literal>,
	<literal>&gt;</literal>.  They return <constant>true</constant> or
	<constant>false</constant>.
	The operators
	<literal>!=</literal> and <literal>&lt;&gt;</literal> are the same
	thing and mean "is not equal to".
	GEL also supports the operator
	<literal>&lt;=&gt;</literal>, which returns -1 if left side is
	smaller, 0 if both sides are equal, 1 if left side is larger.
      </para>

      <para>
	Normally <literal>=</literal> is translated to <literal>==</literal> if
	it happens to be somewhere where GEL is expecting a condition such as
	in the if condition.  For example
	<programlisting>if a=b then c
if a==b then c
</programlisting>
	are the same thing in GEL.  However you should really use
	<literal>==</literal> or <literal>:=</literal> when you want to compare
	or assign respectively if you want your code to be easy to read and
	to avoid mistakes.
      </para>

      <para>
	All the comparison operators (except for the
	<literal>&lt;=&gt;</literal> operator, which

	(<literal>1&lt;x&lt;=y&lt;5</literal>) is

	To build up logical expressions use the words <literal>not</literal>,
	<literal>and</literal>, <literal>or</literal>, <literal>xor</literal>.
	The operators <literal>or</literal> and <literal>and</literal> are
special beasts as they evaluate their arguments one by one, so the usual trick
for conditional evaluation works here as well. For example, <literal>1 or a=1</literal> will not set
<literal>a=1</literal> since the first argument was true.

	<para>
	  GEL is a
	  <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28programming%29">
	  dynamically scoped language</ulink>.  We will explain what this
	  means below.  That is, normal variables and functions are dynamically

	<para>
	  Like most programming languages, GEL has different types
	  of variables.  Normally when a variable is defined in a function,
	  it is visible from that function and from all functions that are
	  called (all higher contexts).  For example, suppose a function
	  <function>f</function> defines a variable <varname>a</varname>
	  and then calls function <function>g</function>.  Then
	  function <function>g</function> can reference
	  <varname>a</varname>.  But once <function>f</function> returns,
	  the variable <varname>a</varname> goes out of scope.
	  For example, the following code will print out 5.
	  The function <function>g</function> cannot be called on the
	  top level (outside <function>f</function> as <varname>a</varname>
	  will not be defined).
<programlisting>function f() = (a:=5; g());
function g() = print(a);
f();
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
	  If you define a variable inside a function it will override
	  any variables defined in calling functions.  For example,
	  we modify the above code and write:
<programlisting>function f() = (a:=5; g());
function g() = print(a);
a:=10;
f();
</programlisting>
	  This code will still print out 5.  But if you call
	  <function>g</function> outside of <function>f</function> then
	  you will get a printout of 10.  Note that
	  setting <varname>a</varname>
	  to 5 inside <function>f</function> does not change
	  the value of <varname>a</varname> at the top (global) level,
	  so if you now check the value of <varname>a</varname> it will
	  still be 10.
        </para>
	<para>
	  Function arguments are exactly like variables defined inside
	  the function, except that they are initialized with the value
	  that was passed to the function.  Other than this point, they are
	  treated just like all other variables defined inside the
	  function.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Functions are treated exactly like variables.  Hence you can
	  locally redefine functions.  Normally (on the top level) you
	  cannot redefine protected variables and functions.  But locally
	  you can do this.  Consider the following session:
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>function f(x) = sin(x)^2</userinput>
= (`(x)=(sin(x)^2))
<prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>function f(x) = sin(x)^2</userinput>
= (`(x)=(sin(x)^2))
<prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>function g(x) = ((function sin(x)=x^10);f(x))</userinput>
= (`(x)=((sin:=(`(x)=(x^10)));f(x)))
<prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>g(10)</userinput>
= 1e20
</screen>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Functions and variables defined at the top level are
	  considered global.  They are visible from anywhere.  As we
	  said the following function <function>f</function>
	  will not change the value of <varname>a</varname> to 5.
<programlisting>a=6;
function f() = (a:=5);
f();
</programlisting>
	  Sometimes, however, it is necessary to set
a global variable from inside a function.  When this behavior is needed,
use the
<link linkend="gel-function-set"><function>set</function></link> function. Passing a string or a quoted identifier to
this function sets the variable globally (on the top level).
For example, to set
<varname>a</varname> to the value 3 you could call:
<programlisting>set(`a,3)
</programlisting>
or:
<programlisting>set("a",3)
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
	  The <function>set</function> function always sets the toplevel
	  global.  There is no way to set a local variable in some function
	  from a subroutine.  If this is required, must use passing by
	  reference.
        </para>
	<para>

		<link linkend="gel-function-SetElement"><function>SetElement</function></link> and
		<link linkend="gel-function-SetVElement"><function>SetVElement</function></link> functions.
	</para>
	<para>
	  So to recap in a more technical language:  Genius operates with
	  different numbered contexts.  The top level is the context 0
	  (zero).  Whenever a function is entered, the context is raised,
	  and when the function returns the context is lowered.  A function
	  or a variable is always visible from all higher numbered contexts.
	  When a variable was defined in a lower numbered context, then
	  setting this variable has the effect of creating a new local
	  variable in the current context number and this variable
	  will now be visible from all higher numbered contexts.
	</para>
	<para>
	  There are also true local variables that are not seen from
	  anywhere but the current context.  Also when returning functions
	  by value it may reference variables not visible from higher context
	  and this may be a problem.  See the sections
	  <link linkend="genius-gel-true-local-variables">True
	  Local Variables</link> and

]]></programlisting>
	  From then on, <varname>foo</varname> is a strictly global variable.

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-returning">
      <title>Returning</title>
	<para>
	  Normally a function is one or several expressions separated by a
semicolon, and the value of the last expression is returned.  This is fine for
simple functions, but
sometimes you do not want a function to return the last thing calculated. You may, for example, want to return from a middle of a function. In this case, you can use the <literal>return</literal> keyword. <literal>return</literal> takes one argument, which is the value to be returned.
      </para>
      <para>
Example:
<programlisting><![CDATA[function f(x) = (
  y=1;
  while true do (
    if x>50 then return y;
    y=y+1;
    x=x+1
  )
)
]]></programlisting>

    </sect1>


    <sect1 id="genius-gel-references">
      <title>References</title>
      <para>
	It may be necessary for some functions to return more than one value.
	This may be accomplished by returning a vector of values, but many
	times it is convenient to use passing a reference to a variable.
	You pass a reference to a variable to a function, and the function
	will set the variable for you using a dereference.  You do not have
	to use references only for this purpose, but this is their main use.
      </para>
      <para>
	When using functions that return values through references
	in the argument list, just pass the variable name with an ampersand.
	For example the following code will compute an eigenvalue of a matrix
	<varname>A</varname> with initial eigenvector guess
	<varname>x</varname>, and store the computed eigenvector
	into the variable named <varname>v</varname>:
<programlisting><![CDATA[RayleighQuotientIteration (A,x,0.001,100,&v)
]]></programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
The details of how references work and the syntax is similar to the C language.
The operator
<literal>&amp;</literal> references a variable
and <literal>*</literal> dereferences a variable. Both can only be applied to an identifier,
so <literal>**a</literal> is not a legal expression in GEL.
      </para>
      <para>
References are best explained by an example:
<programlisting><![CDATA[a=1;
b=&a;
*b=2;
]]></programlisting>
now <varname>a</varname> contains 2.  You can also reference functions:
<programlisting><![CDATA[function f(x) = x+1;
t=&f;
*t(3)
]]></programlisting>
gives us 4.

If you detect an error in your function, you can bail out of it. For normal

	The syntax is slightly different if you enter statements on
	the top level versus when they are inside parentheses or
	inside functions.  On the top level, enter acts the same as if
	you press return on the command line.  Therefore think of programs
	as just a sequence of lines as if they were entered on the command line.
	In particular, you do not need to enter the separator at the end of the
	line (unless it is part of several statements inside
	parentheses).  When a statement does not end with a separator on the
	top level, the result is printed after being executed.
      </para>
      <para>
	For example,
	<programlisting>function f(x)=x^2
f(3)
</programlisting>
	will print first the result of setting a function (a representation of
	the function, in this case <computeroutput>(`(x)=(x^2))</computeroutput>)
	and then the expected 9.  To avoid this, enter a separator
	after the function definition.
	<programlisting>function f(x)=x^2;
f(3)
</programlisting>
	If you need to put a separator into your function then you have to surround with
	parenthesis.  For example:

    y = y+j;
  y^2
);

     <sect1 id="genius-gel-returning-functions">
       <title>Returning Functions</title>
	<para>
	  It is possible to return functions as value.  This way you can
	  build functions that construct special purpose functions according
	  to some parameters.  The tricky bit is what variables does the
	  function see.  The way this works in GEL is that when a function
	  returns another function, all identifiers referenced in the
	  function body that went out of scope
	  are prepended a private dictionary of the returned
	  function.  So the function will see all variables that were in
	  scope
	  when it was defined.  For example, we define a function that
	  returns a function that adds 5 to its argument.
<programlisting>function f() = (
  k = 5;
  `(x) = (x+k)
)
</programlisting>
	  Notice that the function adds <varname>k</varname> to
	  <varname>x</varname>.  You could use this as follows.
<programlisting>g = f();
g(5)
</programlisting>
	  And <userinput>g(5)</userinput> should return 10.
        </para>
	<para>
	  One thing to note is that the value of <varname>k</varname>
	  that is used is the one that's in effect when the
	  <function>f</function> returns.  For example:
<programlisting>function f() = (
  k := 5;
  function r(x) = (x+k);
  k := 10;
  r
)
</programlisting>
	  will return a function that adds 10 to its argument rather than
	  5.  This is because the extra dictionary is created only when
	  the context
	  in which the function was defined ends, which is when the function
	  <function>f</function> returns.  This is consistent with how you
	  would expect the function <function>r</function> to work inside
	  the function <function>f</function> according to the rules of
	  scope of variables in GEL.  Only those variables are added to the
	  extra dictionary that are in the context that just ended and
	  no longer exists.  Variables
	  used in the function that are in still valid contexts will work
	  as usual, using the current value of the variable.
	  The only difference is with global variables and functions.
	  All identifiers that referenced global variables at time of
	  the function definition are not added to the private dictionary.
	  This is to avoid much unnecessary work when returning functions
	  and would rarely be a problem.  For example, suppose that you
	  delete the "k=5" from the function <function>f</function>,
	  and at the top level you define <varname>k</varname> to be
	  say 5.  Then when you run <function>f</function>, the function
	  <function>r</function> will not put <varname>k</varname> into
	  the private dictionary because it was global (toplevel)
	  at the time of definition of <function>r</function>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Sometimes it is better to have more control over how variables
	  are copied into the private dictionary.  Since version 1.0.7,
	  you can specify which
	  variables are copied into the private dictionary by putting
	  extra square brackets after the arguments with the list of
	  variables to be copied separated by commas.
	  If you do this, then variables are
	  copied into the private dictionary at time of the function
	  definition, and the private dictionary is not touched afterwards.
	  For example
<programlisting>function f() = (
  k := 5;
  function r(x) [k] = (x+k);
  k := 10;
  r
)
</programlisting>
	  will return a function that when called will add 5 to its
	  argument.  The local copy of <varname>k</varname> was created
	  when the function was defined.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When you want the function to not have any private dictionary
	  then put empty square brackets after the argument list.  Then
	  no private dictionary will be created at all.  Doing this is
	  good to increase efficiency when a private dictionary is not
	  needed or when you want the function to lookup all variables
	  as it sees them when called.  For example suppose you want
	  the function returned from <function>f</function> to see
	  the value of <varname>k</varname> from the toplevel despite
	  there being a local variable of the same name during definition.
	  So the code
<programlisting>function f() = (
  k := 5;
  function r(x) [] = (x+k);
  r
);
k := 10;
g = f();
g(10)
</programlisting>
	  will return 20 and not 15, which would happen if
	  <varname>k</varname> with a value of 5 was added to the private
	  dictionary.
	</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-true-local-variables">
      <title>True Local Variables</title>
      <para>
	When passing functions into other functions, the normal scoping of
	variables might be undesired.  For example:
<programlisting>k := 10;
function r(x) = (x+k);
function f(g,x) = (
  k := 5;
  g(x)
);
f(r,1)
</programlisting>
	you probably want the function <function>r</function>
	when passed as <function>g</function> into <function>f</function>
	to see <varname>k</varname> as 10 rather than 5, so that
	the code returns 11 and not 6.  However, as written, the function
	when executed will see the <varname>k</varname> that is
	equal to 5.  There are two ways to solve this.  One would be
	to have <function>r</function> get <varname>k</varname> in a
	private dictionary using the square bracket notation section
	<link linkend="genius-gel-returning-functions">Returning
	Functions</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
	But there is another solution.  Since version 1.0.7 there are
	true local variables.  These are variables that are visible only
	from the current context and not from any called functions.
	We could define <varname>k</varname> as a local variable in the
	function <function>f</function>.  To do this add a
	<command>local</command> statement as the first statement in the
	function (it must always be the first statement in the function).
	You can also make any arguments be local variables as well.
	That is,
<programlisting>function f(g,x) = (
  local g,x,k;
  k := 5;
  g(x)
);
</programlisting>
	Then the code will work as expected and prints out 11.
	Note that the <command>local</command> statement initializes
	all the referenced variables (except for function arguments) to
	a <constant>null</constant>.
      </para>
      <para>
	If all variables are to be created as locals you can just pass an
	asterisk instead of a list of variables.  In this case the variables
	will not be initialized until they are actually set.
	So the following definition of <function>f</function>
	will also work:
<programlisting>function f(g,x) = (
  local *;
  k := 5;
  g(x)
);
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	It is good practice that all functions that take other functions
	as arguments use local variables.  This way the passed function 
	does not see implementation details and get confused.

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-matrix-support">
      <title>Entering Matrices</title>
      <para>
To enter matrices, you can use one of the following two syntaxes. You can either enter
the matrix on one line, separating values by commas and rows by semicolons.  Or you
can enter each row on one line, separating
values by commas.
You can also just combine the two methods.
So to enter a 3x3 matrix
of numbers 1-9 you could do
<programlisting>[1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9]
</programlisting>
or
<programlisting>[1, 2, 3
 4, 5, 6
 7, 8, 9]
</programlisting>
Do not use both ';' and return at once on the same line though.
      </para>

      <para>
You can also use the matrix expansion functionality to enter matrices.
For example you can do:
<programlisting>a = [ 1, 2, 3
      4, 5, 6
      7, 8, 9]
b = [ a,  10
      11, 12]
</programlisting>
and you should get
<programlisting>[1,   2,  3, 10
 4,   5,  6, 10
 7,   8,  9, 10
 11, 11, 11, 12]
</programlisting>
similarly you can build matrices out of vectors and other stuff like that.
      </para>

      <para>
Another thing is that non-specified spots are initialized to 0, so
<programlisting>[1, 2, 3
 4, 5
 6]
</programlisting>
will end up being
<programlisting>
[1, 2, 3
 4, 5, 0
 6, 0, 0]
</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>
	When matrices are evaluated, they are evaluated and traversed row-wise.  This is just

      <note>
        <para>
Be careful about using returns for expressions inside the
<literal>[ ]</literal> brackets, as they have a slightly different meaning
there.  You will start a new row.

      <title>Conjugate Transpose and Transpose Operator</title>
      <para>
You can conjugate transpose a matrix by using the <literal>'</literal> operator.  That is
the entry in the

the complex conjugate of the entry in the
<varname>j</varname>th column and the <varname>i</varname>th row of the original matrix.
 For example:
<programlisting>[1,2,3]*[4,5,6]'
</programlisting>
We transpose the second vector to make matrix multiplication possible.
If you just want to transpose a matrix without conjugating it, you would
use the <literal>.'</literal> operator.  For example:
<programlisting>[1,2,3]*[4,5,6i].'
</programlisting>
      </para>

	  Note that normal transpose, that is the <literal>.'</literal> operator, is much faster

	&appname; implements many useful linear algebra and matrix manipulation
routines.  See the <link
linkend="genius-gel-function-list-linear-algebra">Linear Algebra</link> and
<link linkend="genius-gel-function-list-matrix">Matrix Manipulation</link>
sections of the GEL function listing.
      </para>
      <para>
	The linear algebra routines implemented in GEL do not currently come
from a well tested numerical package, and thus should not be used for critical
numerical computation.  On the other hand, Genius implements very well many
linear algebra operations with rational and integer coefficients.  These are
inherently exact and in fact will give you much better results than common
double precision routines for linear algebra.
      </para>
      <para>
	For example, it is pointless to compute the rank and nullspace of a
floating point matrix since for all practical purposes, we need to consider the
matrix as having some slight errors.  You are likely to get a different result
than you expect.  The problem is that under a small perturbation every matrix
is of full rank and invertible.  If the matrix however is of rational numbers,
then the rank and nullspace are always exact.
      </para>
      <para>
	In general when &appname; computes the basis of a certain vectorspace
	(for example with the <link linkend="gel-function-NullSpace"><function>NullSpace</function></link>) it will give the basis as
a matrix, in which the columns are the vectors of the basis.  That is, when
&appname; talks of a linear subspace it means a matrix whose column space is
the given linear subspace.
      </para>
      <para>
	It should be noted that &appname; can remember certain properties of a
matrix.  For example, it will remember that a matrix is in row reduced form.
If many calls are made to functions that internally use row reduced form of
the matrix, we can just row reduce the matrix beforehand once.  Successive
calls to <link linkend="gel-function-rref"><function>rref</function></link> will be very fast.

  <!-- ============= Polynomials ============================== -->
  <chapter id="genius-gel-polynomials">
    <title>Polynomials in GEL</title>

    <para>
      Currently &appname; can handle polynomials of one variable written out
      as vectors, and do some basic operations with these.  It is planned to
      expand this support further.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-polynomials-using">
      <title>Using Polynomials</title>
      <para>
Currently
polynomials in one variable are just horizontal vectors with value only nodes.
The power of the term is the position in the vector, with the first position
being 0. So,
<programlisting>[1,2,3]
</programlisting>
translates to a polynomial of
<programlisting>1 + 2*x + 3*x^2
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
You can add, subtract and multiply polynomials using the
<link linkend="gel-function-AddPoly"><function>AddPoly</function></link>,
<link linkend="gel-function-SubtractPoly"><function>SubtractPoly</function></link>, and
<link linkend="gel-function-MultiplyPoly"><function>MultiplyPoly</function></link> functions respectively.
You can print a polynomial using the
<link linkend="gel-function-PolyToString"><function>PolyToString</function></link>
function.
For example,
<programlisting>PolyToString([1,2,3],"y")
</programlisting>
gives
<programlisting>3*y^2 + 2*y + 1
</programlisting>
You can also get a function representation of the polynomial so that you can
evaluate it. This is done by using
<link linkend="gel-function-PolyToFunction"><function>PolyToFunction</function></link>,
which
returns an anonymous function.
<programlisting>f = PolyToFunction([0,1,1])
f(2)
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	It is also possible to find roots of polynomials of degrees 1 through 4 by using the
function
<link linkend="gel-function-PolynomialRoots"><function>PolynomialRoots</function></link>,
which calls the appropriate formula function.  Higher degree polynomials must be converted to
functions and solved
numerically using a function such as
<link linkend="gel-function-FindRootBisection"><function>FindRootBisection</function></link>,
<link linkend="gel-function-FindRootFalsePosition"><function>FindRootFalsePosition</function></link>,
<link linkend="gel-function-FindRootMullersMethod"><function>FindRootMullersMethod</function></link>, or
<link linkend="gel-function-FindRootSecant"><function>FindRootSecant</function></link>.

  <!-- ============= Set Theory ============================== -->
  <chapter id="genius-gel-settheory">
    <title>Set Theory in GEL</title>

    <para>
      &appname; has some basic set theoretic functionality built in.  Currently a set is
      just a vector (or a matrix).  Every distinct object is treated as a different element.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-sets-using">
      <title>Using Sets</title>
      <para>
	Just like vectors, objects
      in sets can include numbers, strings, <constant>null</constant>, matrices and vectors.  It is
      planned in the future to have a dedicated type for sets, rather than using vectors.
      Note that floating point numbers are distinct from integers, even if they appear the same.
      That is, &appname; will treat <constant>0</constant> and <constant>0.0</constant>
      as two distinct elements.  The <constant>null</constant> is treated as an empty set.
    </para>
      <para>
	To build a set out of a vector, use the 
	<link linkend="gel-function-MakeSet"><function>MakeSet</function></link> function.
	Currently, it will just return a new vector where every element is unique.
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>MakeSet([1,2,2,3])</userinput>
= [1, 2, 3]
</screen>
</para>

	<para>
	Similarly there are functions 
	<link linkend="gel-function-Union"><function>Union</function></link>,
	<link linkend="gel-function-Intersection"><function>Intersection</function></link>,
	<link linkend="gel-function-SetMinus"><function>SetMinus</function></link>, which
	are rather self explanatory.  For example:
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>Union([1,2,3], [1,2,4])</userinput>
= [1, 2, 4, 3]
</screen>
	Note that no order is guaranteed for the return values.  If you wish to sort the vector you
should use the
	<link linkend="gel-function-SortVector"><function>SortVector</function></link> function.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For testing membership, there are functions
	<link linkend="gel-function-IsIn"><function>IsIn</function></link> and
	<link linkend="gel-function-IsSubset"><function>IsSubset</function></link>,
	which return a boolean value.  For example:
<screen><prompt>genius> </prompt><userinput>IsIn (1, [0,1,2])</userinput>
= true
</screen>
	The input <userinput>IsIn(x,X)</userinput> is equivalent to
	<userinput>IsSubset([x],X)</userinput>.  Note that since the empty set is a subset
	of every set, <userinput>IsSubset(null,X)</userinput> is always true.

	    This is the LU decomposition of a matrix aka Crout and/or Cholesky
	    reduction.
	    (ISBN 0-201-11577-8 pp.99-103)
	    The upper triangular matrix features a diagonal
	    of values 1 (one).  This is not Doolittle's Method, which features
	    the 1's diagonal on the lower matrix. 
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Not all matrices have LU decompositions, for example
	    <userinput>[0,1;1,0]</userinput> does not and this function returns
	    <constant>false</constant> in this case and sets <varname>L</varname>
	    and <varname>U</varname> to <constant>null</constant>.

		  Unlike many other functions that do not care if they take a
		  column or a row vector, if specifying points as a vector of
		  complex values, due to possible ambiguities, it must always
		  be given as a column vector.  Therefore, notice in the

		  to make it into a column vector.

  <!-- ============= GEL examples ============================= -->
  <chapter id="genius-gel-example-programs">
    <title>Example Programs in GEL</title>

    <para>
Here is a function that calculates factorials:
<programlisting><![CDATA[function f(x) = if x <= 1 then 1 else (f(x-1)*x)
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
With indentation it becomes:
<programlisting><![CDATA[function f(x) = (
  if x <= 1 then
    1
  else
    (f(x-1)*x)
)
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
This is a direct port of the factorial function from the <application>bc</application> manpage. The syntax seems similar to <application>bc</application>, but different in that in GEL, the last expression is the one that is returned. Using the <literal>return</literal> function instead, it would be:
<programlisting><![CDATA[function f(x) = (
  if (x <= 1) then return (1);
  return (f(x-1) * x)
)
]]></programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
By far the easiest way to define a factorial function would be using
the product loop as follows.  This is not only the shortest and fastest,
but also probably the most readable version.
<programlisting>function f(x) = prod k=1 to x do k
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
Here is a larger example, this basically redefines the internal
<link linkend="gel-function-ref"><function>ref</function></link> function to calculate the row echelon form of a
matrix.  The function <function>ref</function> is built in and much faster,
but this example demonstrates some of the more complex features of GEL.
<programlisting><![CDATA[# Calculate the row-echelon form of a matrix
function MyOwnREF(m) = (
  if not IsMatrix(m) or not IsValueOnly(m) then
    (error("MyOwnREF: argument not a value only matrix");bailout);
  s := min(rows(m), columns(m));
  i := 1;
  d := 1;
  while d <= s and i <= columns(m) do (

    # This just makes the anchor element non-zero if at
    # all possible
    if m@(d,i) == 0 then (
      j := d+1;
      while j <= rows(m) do (
        if m@(j,i) == 0 then
          (j=j+1;continue);
        a := m@(j,);
        m@(j,) := m@(d,);
        m@(d,) := a;
        j := j+1;
        break
      )
    );
    if m@(d,i) == 0 then
      (i:=i+1;continue);
    
    # Here comes the actual zeroing of all but the anchor
    # element rows
    j := d+1;
    while j <= rows(m)) do (
      if m@(j,i) != 0 then (
        m@(j,) := m@(j,)-(m@(j,i)/m@(d,i))*m@(d,)
      );
      j := j+1
    );
    m@(d,) := m@(d,) * (1/m@(d,i));
    d := d+1;
    i := i+1
  );
  m

	   Internally all data is put onto small nodes in memory.  This gives

	   if you do something by mistake that uses too much memory, such

	   Once the limit is reached, &app; asks if you wish to interrupt
