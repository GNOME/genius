      <title>Comparison operators</title>
      <para>
	The following standard comparison operators are supported in GEL and have the obvious meaning:
	<literal>==</literal>, <literal>&gt;=</literal>,
	<literal>&lt;=</literal>, <literal>!=</literal>,
	<literal>&lt;&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;</literal>,
	<literal>&gt;</literal>.  They return <literal>true</literal> or
	<literal>false</literal>.
	The operators
	<literal>!=</literal> and <literal>&lt;&gt;</literal> are the same
	thing and mean "is not equal to".
	GEL also supports the operator
	<literal>&lt;=&gt;</literal>, which returns -1 if left side is
	smaller, 0 if both sides are equal, 1 if left side is larger.
      </para>

      <para>
	Normally <literal>=</literal> is translated to <literal>==</literal> if
	it happens to be somewhere where GEL is expecing a condition such as
	in the if condition.  For example
	<programlisting>if a=b then c
if a==b then c
</programlisting>
	are the same thing in GEL.  However you should really use
	<literal>==</literal> or <literal>:=</literal> when you want to compare
	or assign respectively if you want your code to be easy to read and
	to avoid mistakes.
      </para>

      <para>
	All the comparison operators (except for the
	<literal>&lt;=&gt;</literal> operator which
	behaves normally), are not strictly binary operators, they can in fact
	be grouped in the normal mathematical way, e.g.:
	(<literal>1&lt;x&lt;=y&lt;5</literal>) is
	a legal boolean expression and means just what it should, that is
	(1&lt;x and x&le;y and y&lt;5)
      </para>
      <para>
	To build up logical expressions use the words <literal>not</literal>,
	<literal>and</literal>, <literal>or</literal>, <literal>xor</literal>.
	The operators <literal>or</literal> and <literal>and</literal> are
special beasts as they evaluate their arguemnts one by one, so the usual trick
for conditional evaluation works here as well. For example, <literal>1 or a=1</literal> will not set
<literal>a=1</literal> since the first argument was true.
