==,&gt;=,&lt;=,!=,&lt;&gt;,&lt;,&gt; return true or false
      </para>
      <para>
!= and &lt;&gt; are the same thing and mean "is not equal to". Make sure
you use == for equality however, as = will have the same outcomes as
it does in C.

      <para>
&lt;=&gt; returns -1 if left side is smaller, 0 if both sides are equal, 1 if left side is larger

To build up logical expressions use the words "not","and","or","xor"
      </para>
      <para>
"or" and "and" are special beasts as they evaluate their arguemnts one by one, so the usual trick for conditional evaluation works here as well. (e.g., "1 or a=1" will not set a=1 since the first argument was true)
