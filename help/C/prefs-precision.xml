	  The floating point precision in bits
	  (<function>FloatPrecision</function>).
	  Note that changing this only affects newly computed quantities.
	  Old values stored in variables are obviously still in the old
	  precision and if you want to have them more precise you will have
	  to recompute them.  Exceptions to this are the system constants
	  such as <function>pi</function> or
	  <function>e</function>.
