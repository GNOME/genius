	  The floating point precision in bits
	  (<function>FloatPrecision</function>).
	  Note that changing this only affects newly computed quantities.
	  Old values stored in variables are obviously still in the old
	  precision and if you want to have them more precise you will have
	  to recompute them.  Exceptions to this are the system constants
	  such as <function>pi</function> or
	  <function>e</function>.

	   Should the precision setting be remembered for the next session.  If unchecked,
	   either the default or any previously saved setting is used each time &appname; starts
	   up.  Note that
	   settings are saved at the end of the session, so if you wish to change the default
	   check this box, restart genius and then uncheck it again.
