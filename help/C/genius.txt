   About Genius Math Tool
     _________________________________________________________

Introduction

   The  Genius  Math Tool application is a general calculator for
   use   as   a   desktop  calculator,  an  educational  tool  in
   mathematics,  and is useful even for rudimentary research. The
   language  tries to be more `mathematical' in the sense that it
   should  be  `what  you mean is what you get', though of course
   that's  not  an  entirely  attainable  goal. It features using
   rationals, arbitrary precision integers and multiple precision
   floats  using  the GMP library. It also fully supports complex
   numbers.  It  can  work  with  matrices  and  vectors  and  do
   rudimetary  linear algebra. The language can have user-defined
   functions, variables and parameters.

   This  manual  describes  mostly  the  graphical version of the
   calculator,  but  the  language  is  of  course  the same. The
   command  line only version lacks the graphing capabilities and
   all   other  capabilities  that  require  the  graphical  user
   interface.
     _________________________________________________________

Getting Started

To Start Genius Math Tool

   You can start Genius Math Tool in the following ways:

   Applications menu
          Choose Office->Genius Math Tool.

          Note  that  depending  on your system installation this
          menu  item  may not be available. If it is not, you can
          open the Run dialog and executing gnome-genius.

   Command line
          Execute  the  following command: genius. Note that this
          will start the command line only version of genius, the
          graphical environment will not start and some functions
          such  as  plotting  will not be available. To start the
          full GNOME version of Genius execute gnome-genius.
     _________________________________________________________

When You Start Genius

   When  you  start  Genius  Math  Tool,  the following window is
   displayed.

   [genius_window.png]

   Figure 1. Genius Math Tool Window

   The Genius Math Tool window contains the following elements:

   Menubar.
          The  menus  on  the menubar contain all of the commands
          that you need to work with files in Genius Math Tool.

   Toolbar.
          The  toolbar contains a subset of the commands that you
          can access from the menubar.

   Working area
          The  working  area is the primary method of interacting
          with the application.

          The  working  area  initially  has just the Console tab
          which   is   the  main  way  of  interacting  with  the
          calculator.  Here  you type expressions and the results
          are immediately returned after you hit the Enter key.

          Alternatively  you  can write longer programs and those
          can  appear in separate tabs and can be stored in files
          for later retrieval.
     _________________________________________________________

Basic usage

Using the workarea

   Normally  you  interact with the calculator in the Console tab
   of  the  work  area.  If you are running the text only version
   then  the  console will be the only thing that is available to
   you.

   Type your expression into the Console workarea and press enter
   and the expression will be evaluated. To load a program, type
   genius> load path/to/program.gel

   To  list  files  in  the  current directory type ls, to change
   directory do cd directory as in the unix command shell.

   To get a list of functions and commands, type:
   genius> help

   If you wish to get more help on a specific function, type:
   genius> help FunctionName

   To view this manual, type:
   genius> manual

   The  most  simple  GEL  (The  Genius  Extension  Language,  or
   George`s Ego Leverage) expression just looks like mathematics.
   For example
   genius> 30*70 + 67^3.0 + ln(7) * (88.8/100)

   or
genius> 62734 + 812634 + 77^4 mod 5

   or
genius> | sin(37) - e^7 |

   or
genius> sum n=1 to 70 do 1/n

   (Last is the harmonic sum from 1 to 70)
     _________________________________________________________

To Create a New Program

   To  start  writing  a new program, choose File->New Program. A
   new  tab  will  appear  in  the  workarea. You can write a GEL
   program in this workarea.

   To  save  the  program  you've just written, choose File->Save
   As...
     _________________________________________________________

To Open and Run a Program

   To  open  a  file  in  order,  choose  File->Open.  A  new tab
   containing  the  file will appear in the workarea. You can use
   this to edit the file.

   To run a program from a file, choose File->Load and Run....
     _________________________________________________________

GEL Basics

   GEL  stands  for  Genius  Extension Language. Alternatively it
   also  stands for George's Ego Leverage. It is the language you
   use to write programs in Genius. A program in GEL is simply an
   expression that evaluates to a number.
     _________________________________________________________

Values

   Values  in GEL can be numbers, Booleans or strings. Values can
   be  used  in  calculations, assigned to variables and returned
   from functions, among other uses.
     _________________________________________________________

Numbers

   Integers  are  the  first  type of number in GEL. Integers are
   written in the normal way.
   1234

   Hexidecimal and octal numbers can be written using C notation.
   For example:
0x123ABC
01234

   Or   you   can   type  numbers  in  an  arbitrary  base  using
   <base>\<number>.  Digits  higher  than  10  use  letters  in a
   similar  way  to hexidecimal. For example, a number in base 23
   could be written:
23\1234ABCD

   The  second  type  of  GEL  number is rationals. Rationals are
   simply achieved by dividing two integers. So one could write:
   3/4

   to  get  three  quarters. Rationals also accept mixed fraction
   notation.  So  in  order to get one and three tenths you could
   write:
1 3/10

   The  next  type if number is floating point. These are entered
   in  a  similar fashion to C notation. You can use E, e or @ as
   the exponent delimiter. Note that using the exponent delimiter
   gives a float even if there is no decimal point in the number.
   Examples:
1.315
7.887e77
7.887e-77
.3
0.3
77e5

   The  final  type  of number in gel is the complex numbers. You
   can  enter  a  complex  number  as a sum of real and imaginary
   parts. The imaginary part ends with an i. Here are examples of
   entering complex numbers:
1+2i
8.01i
77*e^(1.3i)

   Important When entering imaginary numbers, a number must be in
   front of the i. If you use i by itself, Genius will interpret
   this as referring to the variable i. If you need to refer to i
   by itself, use 1i instead.

   In order to use mixed fraction notation with imaginary numbers
   you must have the mixed fraction in parentheses. (i.e., (1
      2/5)i)
     _________________________________________________________

Booleans

   Genius  also  supports  native Boolean values. The two Boolean
   constants are defined as true and false; these identifiers can
   be  used  like  any  other  variable.  You  can  also  use the
   identifiers  True,  TRUE,  False  and FALSE as aliases for the
   above.

   At  any  place where a Boolean expression is expected, you can
   use  a  Boolean value or any expression that produces either a
   number or a Boolean. If Genius needs to evaluate a number as a
   Boolean  it  will interpret 0 as false and any other number as
   true.

   In  addition,  you  can do arithmetic with Boolean values. For
   example:
   ( (1 + true) - false ) * true

   is the same as:
( (true or true) or not false ) and true

   Only  addition,  subtraction and multiplication are supported.
   If  you  mix  numbers  with Booleans in an expression then the
   numbers  are  converted  to  Booleans as described above. This
   means that, for example:
1 == true

   always  evaluates  to  true  since 1 will be converted to true
   before being compared to true.
     _________________________________________________________

Strings

   Like  numbers  and  Booleans,  strings in GEL can be stored as
   values  inside variables and passed to functions. You can also
   concatenate  a  string  with  another  value  using  the  plus
   operator. For example:
   a=2+3;"The result is: "+a

   will create the string:
The result is: 5

   You  can  also use C-like escape sequences such as \n,\t,\b,\a
   and  \r. To get a \ or " into the string you can quote it with
   a \. For example:
"Slash: \\ Quotes: \" Tabs: \t1\t2\t3"

   will make a string:
Slash: \ Quotes: " Tabs:        1       2       3

   In  addition,  you  can  use  the  library  function string to
   convert anything to a string. For example:
   string(22)

   will return
"22"

   Strings can also be compared with ==, != and <=> operators
     _________________________________________________________

Null

   Null is a special value. No operations can be performed on it,
   and nothing is printed when it is returned. Therefore, Null is
   useful  when  you  do not want output from an expression. Null
   can be obtained as an expression when you type . or nothing.

   Example:
x=5;.
x=5;
     _________________________________________________________

Using Variables

   Syntax:
   VariableName

   Example:
genius> e
= 2.71828182846

   To  evaluate  a variable by itself, just enter the name of the
   variable.  This will return the value of the variable. You can
   use  a  variable  anywhere  you would normally use a number or
   string.  In  addition,  variables  are necessary when defining
   functions that take arguments (see the Section called Defining
   functions).

   Tip Using Tab completion
       You can use Tab completion to get Genius to complete
   variable names for you. Try typing the first few letters of
      the name and pressing Tab.

   Important Variable names are case sensitive
             The names of variables are case sensitive. That means that
   variables named hello, HELLO and Hello are all different
      variables.
     _________________________________________________________

Setting Variables

   Syntax:
<identifier> = <value>
<identifier> := <value>

   Example:
x = 3
x := 3

   To  assign  to  a  variable,  use the = or := operators. These
   operators  set the value of the variable and return the number
   you set, so you can do things like
   a = b = 5

   The  = and := operators can both be used to set variables. The
   difference between them is that the := operator always acts as
   an   assignment  operator,  whereas  the  =  operator  may  be
   interpreted  as  testing  for  equality when used in a context
   where a Boolean expression is expected.
     _________________________________________________________

Global variables

   Sometimes  you'd  like  to set a global variable from inside a
   function.  For this, use the set function. Passing a string or
   a  quoted  identifier  to  this  function  sets  the  variable
   globally. For example, to set a to the value 3 you could call:
   set(`a,3)

   or:
set("a",3)

   Like  most  programming  languages,  Genius  has two different
   types  of  variables:  local (a variable set inside a function
   will  not  exist  outside  the  function)  and global (doesn't
   matter where you set them).
     _________________________________________________________

Built-in variables

   GEL has a number of built-in `variables', such as e. These are
   widely  used constants with a preset value, and they cannot be
   assigned  new  values.  There  are  a number of other built-in
   variables,  such as pi and GoldenRatio. See the Section called
   Constants  in  the  chapter called List of GEL functions for a
   full list.
     _________________________________________________________

Previous result variable

   The Ans and ans variables can be used to get the result of the
   last  expression.  For  example,  if  you  had  performed some
   calculation, to add 389 to the result you could do:
   Ans+389
     _________________________________________________________

Using Functions

   Syntax:
   FunctionName([argument1, argument2, ...])

   Example:
Factorial(5)
cos(2*pi)

   To  evaluate  a  function,  enter  the  name  of the function,
   followed  by  the  arguments  (if  any)  to  the  function  in
   parentheses.  This  will  return  the  result  of applying the
   function  to  its  arguments.  The  number of arguments to the
   function is, of course, different for each function.

   There  are  many built-in functions, such as sin, cos and tan.
   You  can  use  the  help  built-in  function  to get a list of
   available  functions,  or  see  the chapter called List of GEL
   functions for a full listing.

   Tip Using Tab completion
       You can use Tab completion to get Genius to complete
   function names for you. Try typing the first few letters of
      the name and pressing Tab.

   Important Function names are case sensitive
             The names of functions are case sensitive. That means that
   functions named dosomething, DOSOMETHING and DoSomething are
      all different functions.
     _________________________________________________________

Defining functions

   Syntax:
function <identifier>(<comma separated arguments>) = <function body>
<identifier> = (`() = <function body>)

   The  `  is the backquote character, and signifies an anonymous
   function.  By  setting  it  to a variable name you effectively
   define a function.

   A  function  takes zero or more comma separated arguments, and
   returns  the  result  of  the function body. Defining your own
   functions  is  primarily a matter of convenience; one possible
   use  is  to  have sets of functions defined in GEL files which
   Genius can load in order to make available.

   Example:
   function addup(a,b,c) = a+b+c

   then addup(1,4,9) yields 14
     _________________________________________________________

Variable argument lists

   If  you  include  ...  after  the  last  argument  name in the
   function  declaration,  then  Genius  will allow any number of
   arguments  to  be  passed  in  place  of  that argument. If no
   arguments  were passed then that argument will be set to null.
   Otherwise,  it  will be a horizontal vector containing all the
   arguments. For example:
   function f(a,b...) = b

   Then f(1,2,3) yields [2,3], while f(1) yields null.
     _________________________________________________________

Passing functions to functions

   In Genius, it is possible to pass a function as an argument to
   another  function.  This  can  be  done using either `function
   nodes' or anonymous functions.

   If  you  do  not  enter the parentheses after a function name,
   instead  of  being  evaluated,  the  function  will instead be
   returned  as  a `function node'. The function node can then be
   passed to another function.

   Example:
function f(a,b) = a(b)+1;
function b(x) = x*x;
f(b,2)

   If you want to pass a function that doesn't exist yet, you can
   use  an  anonymous  function  (see the Section called Defining
   functions).

   Syntax:
function(<comma separated arguments>) = <function body>
`(<comma separated arguments>) = <function body>

   Example:
function f(a,b) = a(b)+1;
f(`(x) = x*x,2)
     _________________________________________________________

Operations on functions

   Some  functions  allow  arithmetic operations, and some single
   argument  functions  such  as  exp  or  ln,  to operate on the
   function. For example,
   exp(sin*cos+4)

   will return a function that does
exp(sin(x)*cos(x)+4)

   This  can  be  useful  when  quickly  defining  functions. For
   example  to  create a function to perform the above operation,
   you can just type:
f = exp(sin*cos+4)

   This  can  also  be used in plotting. For example, to plot sin
   squared you can enter:
   LinePlot(sin^2)

   Warning Not all functions can be used in this way. In
   addition, when you use a binary operation the functions must
      take the same arguments.
     _________________________________________________________

Absolute value / Modulus

   You can make an absolute value of something by putting the |'s
   around it.
   |a-b|

   In  case the expression is a complex number the result will be
   the modulus (distance from the origin). So for example:
   |3 * e^(1i*pi)|

   returns 3.
     _________________________________________________________

Separator

   In  GEL  if you want to type more than one command you have to
   use  the  ;  operator, which is a way to separate expressions,
   such  a combined expression will return whatever is the result
   of the last one, so
   3 ; 5

   yields 5.

   This  will  require some parenthesizing to make it unambiguous
   sometimes,  especially if the ; is not the top most primitive.
   This  slightly  differs from other programming languages where
   the  ;  is  a  terminator  of  statements, whereas in GEL it's
   actually  a  binary  operator. If you are familiar with pascal
   this  should  be  second  nature.  However  genius can let you
   pretend  it's  a terminator somewhat, if a ";" is found at the
   end  of  a parenthesis or a block, genius will itself append a
   null  node  to  it  as  if you would have written ";". This is
   usefull  in  case  you don't want to return a value from say a
   loop,  or  if  you handle the return differently. Note that it
   will slow down the code if it's executed too often as there is
   one more operator involved.
     _________________________________________________________

Modular evaluation

   Sometimes  when working with large numbers, it might be faster
   if  results  are  modded after each calculation. To use it you
   just add "mod <integer>" after the expression.

   Example:
   2^(5!) * 3^(6!) mod 5

   You  can calculate the inverses of numbers mod some integer by
   just  using  rational  numbers  (of  course the inverse has to
   exist).

   Examples:
10^-1 mod 101
1/10 mod 101

   You  can  also  do  modular evaluation with matrices including
   taking inverses, powers and dividing.

   Example:
A = [1,2;3,4]
B = A^-1 mod 5
A*B mod 5

   This should yield the identity matrix as B will be the inverse
   of A mod 5.

   Some  functions  such  as  sqrt or log work in a different way
   when  in modulo mode. These will then work like their discrete
   versions working within the ring of integers you selected. For
   example:
genius> sqrt(4) mod 7
=
[2      5]
genius> 2*2 mod 7
= 4

   sqrt will actually return all the possible square roots.
     _________________________________________________________

List of GEL operators

   As  everything  in  gel  is  really  just an expression, it is
   really  just  all connected together with operators. Here is a
   list of the operators in GEL.

          a;b

          The separator, just evaluates both a and b, but returns
          only the result of b.

          a=b

          The assignment operator. This assigns b to a (a must be
          a valid lvalue) (note however that this operator may be
          translated  to  ==  if  used  in  a place where boolean
          expression is expected)

          a:=b

          The  assignment  operator.  Assigns b to a (a must be a
          valid  lvalue).  This  is  different  from = because it
          never gets translated to a ==.

          |a|

          Absolute value or modulus (if a is a complex number).

          See Mathworld for more information.

          a^b

          Exponentiation, raises a to the bth power.

          a.^b

          Element  by  element exponentiation. Raise each element
          of  a matrix a to the bth power. Or if b is a matrix of
          the  same  size  as a, then do the operation element by
          element.  If  a  is  a number and b is a matrix then it
          creates  matrix  of the same size as b with a raised to
          all the different powers in b.

          a+b

          Addition.  Adds  two  numbers,  matrices,  functions or
          strings.  If  you  add  a string to anything the result
          will just be a string.

          a-b

          Subtraction.   Subtract   two   numbers,   matrices  or
          functions.

          a*b

          Multiplication.    This    is    the    normal   matrix
          multiplication.

          a.*b

          Element  by  element  multiplication  if  a  and  b are
          matrices.

          a/b

          Division.

          a./b

          Element by element division.

          a\b

          Back division. That is this is the same as b/a.

          a.\b

          Element by element back division.

          a%b

          The  mod  operator.  This  does not turn on the modular
          mode, but just returns the remainder of a/b.

          a.%b

          Element  by  element  the  mod  operator.  Returns  the
          remaineder after element by element a./b.

          a mod b

          Modular   evaluation  operator.  The  expression  a  is
          evaluated  modulo  b.  See  the  Section called Modular
          evaluation.   Some   functions   and  operators  behave
          differently modulo an integer.

          a!

          Factorial operator. This is like 1*...*(n-2)*(n-1)*n.

          a!!

          Double     factorial    operator.    This    is    like
          1*...*(n-4)*(n-2)*n.

          a==b

          Equality operator (returns true or false).

          a!=b

          Inequality operator, returns true if a does not equal b
          else returns false.

          a<>b

          Alternative inequality operator, returns true if a does
          not equal b else returns false.

          a<=b

          Less  than or equal operator, returns true if a is less
          than or equal to b else returns false.

          a>=b

          Greater  than  or  equal operator, returns true if a is
          greater than or equal to b else returns false.

          a<=>b

          Comparison  operator.  If a is equal to b it returns 0,
          if  a  is less than b it returns -1 and if a is greater
          than b it returns 1.

          a and b

          Logical and.

          a or b

          Logical or.

          a xor b

          Logical xor.

          not a

          Logical not.

          -a

          Negation operator.

          &a

          Variable   referencing   (to   pass   a   reference  to
          something).  See  the  Section called References in the
          chapter called Programming with GEL.

          *a

          Variable   dereferencing   (to   access   a  referenced
          varible).  See  the  Section  called  References in the
          chapter called Programming with GEL.

          a'

          Matrix conjugate transpose.

          a.'

          Matrix transpose, does not conjugate the entries.

          a@(b,c)

          Get  element of a matrix in row b and column c. If b, c
          are  vectors,  then  this  gets  the corresponding rows
          columns or submatrices.

          a@(b,)

          Get row of a matrix (or rows if b is a vector).

          a@(b,:)

          Same as above.

          a@(,c)

          Get column of a matrix (or columns if c is a vector).

          a@(:,c)

          Same as above.

          a@(b)

          Get  an  element from a matrix treating it as a vector.
          This will traverse the matrix row-wise.

          a:b

          Build  a  vector  from a to b (or specify a row, column
          region  for  the @ operator). For example to get rows 2
          to 4 of mamtrix A we could do

          A@(2:4,)

          as 2:4 will return a vector [2,3,4].

          a:b:c

          Build  a  vector  from a to c with b as a step. That is
          for example

genius> 1:2:9
=
   `[1     3       5       7       9]

          (a)i

          Make  a imaginary number (multiply a by the imaginary).
          Note  that  normally  the number i is written as 1i. So
          the above is equal to

          (a)*1i

          `a

          Quote  an  identifier so that it doesn't get evaluated.
          Or quote a matrix so that it doesn't get expanded.

   Note The @() operator makes the : operator most useful. With
   this you can specify regions of a matrix. So that a@(2:4,6) is
   the rows 2,3,4 of the column 6. Or a@(,1:2) will get you the
   first two columns of a matrix. You can also assign to the @()
   operator, as long as the right value is a matrix that matches
      the region in size, or if it is any other type of value.

   Note The comparison operators (except for the <=> operator
   which behaves normally), are not strictly binary operators,
   they can in fact be grouped in the normal mathematical way,
   e.g.: (1<x<=y<5) is a legal boolean expression and means just
      what it should, that is (1<x and x=<y and y<5)

   Note The unitary minus operates in a different fashion
   depending on where it appears. If it appears before a number
   it binds very closely, if it appears in front of an expression
   it binds less than the power and factorial operators. So for
   example -1^k is really (-1)^k, but -foo(1)^k is really
   -(foo(1)^k). So be careful how you use it and if in doubt, add
      parentheses.
     _________________________________________________________

Programming with GEL

Conditionals

   Syntax:
   if <expression1> then <expression2> [else <expression3>]

   If  else is omitted, then if the expression1 yields 0, NULL is
   returned.

   Examples:
if(a==5)then(a=a-1)
if b<a then b=a
if c>0 then c=c-1 else c=0
a = ( if b>0 then b else 1 )

   Note  that  =  will  be  translated  to  == if used inside the
   expression for if, so
if a=5 then a=a-1

   will be interpreted as:
if a==5 then a:=a-1
     _________________________________________________________

Loops

While loops

   Syntax:
while <expression1> do <expression2>
until <expression1> do <expression2>
do <expression2> while <expression1>
do <expression2> until <expression1>

   These are similiar to other languages, however they return the
   result of the last iteration or NULL if no iteration was done.
   In the boolean expression, = is translated into == just as for
   the if statement.
     _________________________________________________________

For loops

   Syntax:
for <identifier> = <from> to <to> do <body>
for <identifier> = <from> to <to> by <increment> do <body>

   Loop  with  identifier  being set to all values from <from> to
   <to>,  optionally  using  an increment other than 1. These are
   faster,  nicer  and more compact than the normal loops such as
   above, but less flexible. The identifier must be an identifier
   and  can't  be  a  dereference. The value of identifier is the
   last  value  of  identifier,  or  <from>  if  body  was  never
   evaluated.  The variable is guaranteed to be initialized after
   a  loop,  so  you can safely use it. Also the <from>, <to> and
   <increment>  must  be  non  complex  values.  The  <to> is not
   guaranteed  to be hit, but will never be overshot, for example
   the following prints out odd numbers from 1 to 19:
   for i = 1 to 20 by 2 do print(i)
     _________________________________________________________

Foreach loops

   Syntax:
     for <identifier> in <matrix> do <body>

   For  each  element, going row by row from left to right do the
   body. To print numbers 1,2,3 and 4 in this order you could do:
   for n in [1,2:3,4] do print(n)

   If  you  wish to run through the rows and columns of a matrix,
   you  can use the RowsOf and ColumnsOf functions which return a
   vector of the rows or columns of the matrix. So,
   for n in RowsOf ([1,2:3,4]) do print(n)

   will print out [1,2] and then [3,4].
     _________________________________________________________

Break and continue

   You can also use the break and continue commands in loops. The
   continue continue command will restart the current loop at its
   next  iteration,  while  the  break  command exits the current
   loop.
while(<expression1>) do (
  if(<expression2>) break
  else if(<expression3>) continue;
  <expression4>
)
     _________________________________________________________

Sums and products

   Syntax:
sum <identifier> = <from> to <to> do <body>
sum <identifier> = <from> to <to> by <increment> do <body>
sum <identifier> in <matrix> do <body>
prod <identifier> = <from> to <to> do <body>
prod <identifier> = <from> to <to> by <increment> do <body>
prod <identifier> in <matrix> do <body>

   If  you  substitute  for with sum or prod, then you will get a
   sum  or  a product instead of a for loop. Instead of returning
   the  last  value,  these will return the sum or the product of
   the values respectively.

   If  no body is executed (for example sum i=1 to 0 do ...) then
   sum   returns  0  and  prod  returns  1  as  is  the  standard
   convention.
     _________________________________________________________

Comparison operators

   ==, >=, <=, !=, <>, <, > return true or false.

   != and <> are the same thing and mean "is not equal to".

   Normally  =  is translated to == if it happens to be somewhere
   where GEL is expecing a condition such as in the if condition.
   For example
if a=b then c
if a==b then c

   are the same thing in GEL. However you should really use == or
   := when you want to compare or assign respectively if you want
   your code to be easy to read and to avoid mistakes.

   All  the  comparison  operators  (except  for the <=> operator
   which  behaves  normally),  are not strictly binary operators,
   they  can  in  fact be grouped in the normal mathematical way,
   e.g.:  (1<x<=y<5) is a legal boolean expression and means just
   what it should, that is (1<x and x=<y and y<5)

   The <=> operator returns -1 if left side is smaller, 0 if both
   sides are equal, 1 if left side is larger.

   To  build  up  logical expressions use the words not, and, or,
   xor.

   "or"  and  "and"  are  special  beasts  as they evaluate their
   arguemnts  one  by  one,  so  the  usual trick for conditional
   evaluation  works here as well. (e.g., "1 or a=1" will not set
   a=1 since the first argument was true)
     _________________________________________________________

Returning

   Sometimes  you don't want to return the last thing calculated.
   You  may,  for  example,  want  to  return  from a middle of a
   function. In this case, you can use the return keyword. return
   takes one argument, which is the value to be returned.

   Example:
function f(x) = (
  y=1;
  while true do (
    if x>50 then return y;
    y=y+1;
    x=x+1
  )
)
     _________________________________________________________

References

   GEL  contains  references with a C like syntax. & references a
   variable  and  *  dereferences  a  variable.  Both can only be
   applied to an identifier, so **a is not legal in GEL.

   Example:
a=1;
b=&a;
*b=2;

   now 'a' contains 2.
function f(x) = x+1;
t=&f;
*t(3)

   gives us 4.
     _________________________________________________________

Lvalues

   An  lvalue  is  the  left hand side of an assignment. In other
   words,  an  lvalue  is  what  you  assign  something to. Valid
   lvalues are:

   a
          identifier

   *a
          dereference of an identifier

   a@(&#12296;region&#12297;)
          a  region  of  a  matrix (where the region is specified
          normally as with the regular @() operator)

   Examples:
a=4
*tmp = 89
a@(4..8,3)=[1,2,3,4,5]'
     _________________________________________________________

Advanced Programming with GEL

Error handling

   If  you  detect an error in your function, you can bail out of
   it.  For  normal errors, such as wrong types of arguments, you
   can fail to compute the function by adding the empty statement
   bailout.  If  something  went  really  wrong  and  you want to
   completely   kill   the   current  computation,  you  can  use
   exception.

   Look at lib.gel for some examples.
     _________________________________________________________

GEL startup procedure

   First  the  program  looks for the installed library file (the
   compiled version lib.cgel) in the installed directory, then it
   looks into the current directory, and then it tries to load an
   uncompiled file called ~/.geniusinit.

   If you ever change the the library its installed place, you'll
   have  to  first  compile it with genius --compile loader.gel >
   lib.cgel
     _________________________________________________________

Loading programs

   Sometimes you have a larger program that you wrote into a file
   and  want  to read in that file. In these situations, you have
   two  options.  You  can keep the functions you use most inside
   the  ~/.geniusinit file. Or if you want to load up a file in a
   middle  of  a  session  (or from within another file), you can
   type  load  <list  of filenames> at the prompt. This has to be
   done  on the top level and not inside any function or whatnot,
   and  it  cannot  be  part  of  any  expression.  It also has a
   slightly  different  syntax  than  the  rest  of  genius, more
   similiar  to a shell. You can enter the file in quotes. If you
   use  the  ''  quotes, you will get exactly the string that you
   typed,  if  you  use the "" quotes, special characters will be
   unescaped as they are for strings. Example:
load program1.gel program2.gel
load "Weird File Name With SPACES.gel"

   There  are also cd, pwd and ls commands built in. cd will take
   one  argument, ls will take an argument which is like the glob
   in  the unix shell (i.e., you can use wildcards). pwd takes no
   arguments. For example:
cd directory_with_gel_programs
ls *.gel
     _________________________________________________________

Matrices in GEL

Matrix support

   To  enter  matrixes use one of the following two syntaxes. You
   can  either  enter  the matrix separating values by commas and
   rows  by semicolons, or separating values by tabs (not usually
   easily  possible  on  the  console, only in files) and rows by
   returns,  or  any  combination  of  the two. So to enter a 3x3
   matrix of numbers 1-9 you could do
   [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9]

   or
[1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9]

   or
[1, 2, 3
 4, 5, 6
 7, 8, 9]

   Do  not  use  both  ';'  and  return  at once on the same line
   though.  Also do not mix tabs and commas. It is just safest to
   use commas as separators.

   You  can  also use the matrix expansion functionality to enter
   matricies. For example you can do:
a = [ 1, 2, 3
      4, 5, 6
      7, 8, 9]
b = [ a,  10
      11, 12]

   and you should get
[1  2  3  10
 4  5  6  10
 7  8  9  10
 11 11 11 12]

   similiarly  you  can  build matricies out of vectors and other
   stuff like that.

   Another  thing  is that non-specified spots are initialized to
   0, so
[1, 2, 3
 4, 5
 6]

   will end up being
[1 2 3
 4 5 0
 6 0 0]

   Note Be careful about using whitespace and returns for
   expressions inside the [ ] brackets, as they have a slightly
      different meaning and could mess you up.
     _________________________________________________________

Conjugate transpose and transpose operator

   You  can conjugate transpose a matrix by using the ' operator.
   For example:
   [1,2,3]*[4,5,6]'

   We  transpose  the second vector to make matrix multiplication
   possible.

   If you just want to transpose a matrix without conjugating it,
   you would use the .' operator. For example:
   [1,2,3]*[4,5,6i].'
     _________________________________________________________

Polynomials in GEL

   Currently  Genius  can  handle  polynomials  of  one  variable
   written out as vectors and do some basic operations with them.
   It is planned to expand this support further.
     _________________________________________________________

Using Polynomials

   Genius  can  do  some  things  on  polynomials. Polynomials in
   Genius  are just horizontal vectors with value only nodes. The
   power  of  the  term  is  the position in the vector, with the
   first position being 0. So,
   [1,2,3]

   translates to a polynomial of
1 + 2*x + 3*x^2

   You  can  add,  subtract  and  multiply  polynomials using the
   AddPoly, SubtractPoly and MultiplyPoly functions respectively.
   You  can  print  a polynomial using the PolyToString function.
   For example,
   PolyToString([1,2,3],"y")

   gives
3*y^2 + 2*y + 1

   You  can  also get a function representation of the polynomial
   so   that   you  can  evaluate  it.  This  is  done  by  using
   PolyToFunction,  which returns an anonymous function which you
   can assign to something.
f = PolyToFunction([0,1,1])
f(2)

   Look  at  the  function  table  for  the  rest  of  polynomial
   functions.

          product.

          See Factorize.

          number

          number  of integers between 1 and n relatively prime to
          n.

          See Planetmath or Mathworld for more information.

   ExactDivision

          ExactDivision (n,d)

          Return  n/d  but  only  if  d  divides n. If d does not
          divide  n then this function returns garbage. This is a
          lot  faster  for  very large numbers than the operation
          n/d,  but  of  course  only useful if you know that the
          division is exact.

   Factorize

          Factorize (n)

          Return factorization of a number as a matrix. The first
          row  is  the  primes in the factorization (including 1)
          and the second row are the powers. So for example:

genius> Factorize(11*11*13)

          the  non-prime  factors  as well. It includes 1 and the
          number  itself. So for example to print all the perfect
          numbers  (those  that  are sums of their factors) up to
          the  number  1000  you could do (this is of course very
          inefficent)

for n=1 to 1000 do (
    if MatrixSum (Factors(n)) == 2*n then
        print(n)
   )

   FermatFactorization

          returns   t  and  s  as  a  vector  if  possible,  null
          otherwise.  tries  specifies the number of tries before
          giving up.

          This  is  a fairly good factorization if your number is
          the  product of two factors that are very close to each
          other.

   FindPrimitiveElementMod

          FindPrimitiveElementMod (q)

          Compute  discrete  log  base  b of n in F_q (q a prime)
          using the factor base S. S should be a column of primes
          possibly    with   second   column   precalculated   by
          IndexCalculusPrecalculation.

   IndexCalculusPrecalculation

          IndexCalculusPrecalculation (b,q,S)

          Run   the  precalculation  step  of  IndexCalculus  for
          logarithms  base  b  in  F_q (q a prime) for the factor
          base S (where S is a column vector of primes). The logs
          will  be  precalculated  and  returned  in  the  second
          column.

   IsPerfectSquare

          IsPerfectSquare (n)

          Check  a  number for being a perfect square. The number
          must be a real integer. Negative integers are of course
          never perfect squares.

   IsPrime

          IsPrime (n)

          Tests  primality  of  integers,  for  numbers less than
          25*10^9   the   answer  is  deterministic  (if  Riemann
          hypothesis   is   true).   For   numbers   larger,  the
          probability    of   a   false   positive   depends   on
          IsPrimeMillerRabinReps.  That  is  the  probability  of
          false positive is 1/4 to the power
          IsPrimeMillerRabinReps.  The default value of 22 yields
          a probability of about 5.7e-14.

          If  false  is returned, you can be sure that the number
          is  a composite. If you want to be absolutely sure that
          you have a prime you can use MillerRabinTestSure but it
          may take a lot longer.

          of   times.   The  probability  of  false  positive  is
          (1/4)^reps.  It  is  probably  usually  better  to  use
          IsPrime  since  that  is  faster  and better on smaller
          integers.

   NextPrime

          NextPrime (n)

          Returns  the  least  prime greater than n. Negatives of
          primes  are considered prime and so to get the previous
          prime you can use -NextPrime(-n).

          This  uses  the  GMP's mpz_nextprime which in turn uses
          the probabilistic Miller-Rabin test. The probability of
          false  positive  is  not tunable, but is low enough for
          all practical purposes.

          called L and the upper matrix in a variable called U.

          This  is  the  LU  decomposition  of a matrix aka Crout
          and/or    Cholesky   reduction.   (ISBN   0-201-11577-8
          pp.99-103)  The  upper  triangular  matrix  features  a
          diagonal  of  values  1  (one). This is not Doolittle's
          Method  which  features  the  1's diagonal on the lower
          matrix.

          Not  all  matrices  have LU decompositions, for example
          [0,1;1,0]  does  not and this function returns false in
          this case and sets L and U to null.

Example programs in GEL

   Here is a function that calculates factorials:
   function f(x) = if x <= 1 then 1 else (f(x-1)*x)

   With indentation it becomes:
function f(x) = (
  if x <= 1 then
    1
  else
    (f(x-1)*x)
)

   This  is  a  direct port of the factorial function from the bc
   manpage. The syntax seems similar to bc, but different in that
   in GEL, the last expression is the one that is returned. Using
   the return function instead, it would be:
function f(x) = (
  if (x <= 1) then return (1);
  return (f(x-1) * x)
)

   This  is  a  smaller,  nicer, iterative version, that uses the
   product loop:
   function f(x) = prod k=1 to x do k

   Here  is  a  larger  example,  this  basically  redefines  the
   internal  ref  function  to  calculate  the same thing, but is
   written in GEL:
# Calculate the row-echelon form of a matrix
function MyOwnREF(m) = (
  if not IsMatrix(m) or not IsValueOnly(m) then
    (error("ref: argument not a value only matrix");bailout);
  s = min(rows(m), columns(m));
  i = 1;
  d = 1;
  while d <= s and i <= columns(m) do (

    # This just makes the anchor element non-zero if at
    # all possible
    if m@(d,i) == 0 then (
      j = d+1;
      while j <= rows(m) do (
        if m@(j,i) == 0 then
          (j=j+1;continue);
        a = m@(j,);
        m@(j,) = m@(d,);
        m@(d,) = a;
        j = j+1;
        break
      )
    );
    if m@(d,i) == 0 then
      (i=i+1;continue);

    # Here comes the actual zeroing of all but the anchor
    # element rows
    j = d+1;
    while j <= rows(m)) do (
      if m@(j,i) != 0 then (
        m@(j,) = m@(j,)-(m@(j,i)/m@(d,i))*m@(d,)
      );
      j = j+1
    );
    m@(d,) = m@(d,) * (1/m@(d,i));
    d = d+1;
    i = i+1
  );
  m

Settings

   To  configure  Genius Math Tool, choose Settings->Preferences.
   There  are several basic parameters provided by the calculator
   in  addition  to  the  ones  provided by the standard library.
   These control how the calculator behaves.

   Note Changing settings with GEL
     Many of the settings in Genius are simply global variables,
   and can be evaluated and assigned to in the same way as normal
   variables. See the Section called Using Variables in the
   chapter called GEL Basics about evaluating and assigning to
   variables, and the Section called Parameters in the chapter
   called List of GEL functions for a list of settings that can
   be modified in this way.

   As an example, you can set the maximum number of digits in a
   result to 12 by typing:
   MaxDigits = 12
     _________________________________________________________

Output

   Maximum digits to output
          The maximum digits in a result (MaxDigits)

   Results as floats
          If  the  results  should  be  always  printed as floats
          (ResultsAsFloats)

   Floats in scientific notation
          If    floats   should   be   in   scientific   notation
          (ScientificNotation)

   Always print full expressions
          Should  we  print  out full expressions for non-numeric
          return values (longer than a line) (FullExpressions)

   Display errors in a dialog
          If  set  the  errors  will  be  displayed  in a seprate
          dialog,  if  unset  the  errors  will be printed on the
          console.

   Display information messages in a dialog
          If  set the information messages will be displayed in a
          seprate  dialog, if unset the information messages will
          be printed on the console.

   Maximum errors to display
          The   maximum   number  of  errors  to  return  on  one
          evaluation  (MaxErrors).  If you set this to 0 then all
          errors are always returned. Usually if some loop causes
          many  errors, then it is unlikely that you will be able
          to  make  sense  out  of  more  than a few of these, so
          seeing a long list of errors is usually not helpful.

   In  addition  to these preferences, there are some preferences
   that  can  only  be  changed  by setting them in the workspace
   console. For others that may affect the output see the Section
   called Parameters in the chapter called List of GEL functions.

   MixedFractions
          If  fractions should be printed as mixed fractions such
          as "1 1/3" rather than "4/3"

   IntegerOutputBase
          The base that will be used to output integers

   OutputStyle
          A string, can be "normal", "latex", "mathml" or "troff"
          and  it  will  effect  how  matrices (and perhaps other
          stuff) is printed, useful for pasting into documents

Precision

   Floating point precision
          The  floating point precision in bits (FloatPrecision).
          Note  that  changing  this  only affects newly computed
          quantities.   Old   values   stored  in  variables  are
