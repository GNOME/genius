Chapter 1. Introduction

   The Genius Math Tool application is a general calculator for
   use as a desktop calculator, an educational tool in
   mathematics, and is useful even for rudimentary research. The
   language tries to be more `mathematical' in the sense that it
   should be `what you mean is what you get', though of course
   that's not an entirely attainable goal. It features using
   rationals, arbitrary precision integers and multiple precision
   floats using the GMP library. It also fully supports complex
   numbers. It can work with matrices and vectors and do
   rudimetary linear algebra. The language can have user-defined
   functions, variables and parameters.

   This manual describes mostly the graphical version of the
   calculator, but the language is of course the same. The
   command line only version lacks the graphing capabilities and
   all other capabilities that require the graphical user
   interface.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Getting Started

2.1. To Start Genius Math Tool

   You can start Genius Math Tool in the following ways:

   Applications menu
          Choose Office->Genius Math Tool.

          Note that depending on your system installation this
          menu item may not be available. If it is not, you can
          open the Run dialog and executing gnome-genius.

   Command line
          Execute the following command: genius. Note that this
          will start the command line only version of genius, the
          graphical environment will not start and some functions
          such as plotting will not be available. To start the
          full GNOME version of Genius execute gnome-genius.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2. When You Start Genius

   When you start Genius Math Tool, the following window is
   displayed.

   Figure 2-1. Genius Math Tool Window

   [genius_window.png]

   The Genius Math Tool window contains the following elements:

   Menubar.
          The menus on the menubar contain all of the commands
          that you need to work with files in Genius Math Tool.

   Toolbar.
          The toolbar contains a subset of the commands that you
          can access from the menubar.

   Working area
          The working area is the primary method of interacting
          with the application.

          The working area initially has just the Console tab
          which is the main way of interacting with the
          calculator. Here you type expressions and the results
          are immediately returned after you hit the Enter key.

          Alternatively you can write longer programs and those
          can appear in separate tabs and can be stored in files
          for later retrieval.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Basic usage

3.1. Using the workarea

   Normally you interact with the calculator in the Console tab
   of the work area. If you are running the text only version
   then the console will be the only thing that is available to
   you.

   Type your expression into the Console workarea and press enter
   and the expression will be evaluated. To load a program, type
genius> load path/to/program.gel

   To list files in the current directory type ls, to change
   directory do cd directory as in the unix command shell.

   To get a list of functions and commands, type:
genius> help

   If you wish to get more help on a specific function, type:
genius> help FunctionName

   To view this manual, type:
genius> manual

   The most simple GEL (The Genius Extension Language, or
   George`s Ego Leverage) expression just looks like mathematics.
   For example
genius> 30*70 + 67^3.0 + ln(7) * (88.8/100)

   or
genius> 62734 + 812634 + 77^4 mod 5

   or
genius> | sin(37) - e^7 |

   or
genius> sum n=1 to 70 do 1/n

   (Last is the harmonic sum from 1 to 70)
     _________________________________________________________

3.2. To Create a New Program

   To start writing a new program, choose File->New Program. A
   new tab will appear in the workarea. You can write a GEL
   program in this workarea.

   To save the program you've just written, choose File->Save
   As...
     _________________________________________________________

3.3. To Open and Run a Program

   To open a file in order, choose File->Open. A new tab
   containing the file will appear in the workarea. You can use
   this to edit the file.

   To run a program from a file, choose File->Load and Run....
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Plotting

   Plotting support is only available in the graphical GNOME
   version. All plotting accessible from the graphical interface
   is available from the Create Plot window. You can access this
   window by either clicking on the Plot button on the toolbar or
   selecting Plot from the Calculator menu. You can also access
   the plotting functionality by using the plotting functions of
   the GEL language. See the chapter on GEL Basics to find out
   how to enter expressions that Genius understands.
     _________________________________________________________

4.1. Line Plots

   To graph real valued functions of one variable open the Create
   Plot window. You can also use the LinePlot function on the
   command line (see its documentation).

   Once you click the Plot button, a window opens up with some
   notebooks in it. You want to be in the "Function line plot"
   notebook tab, and inside you want to be on the "Functions /
   Expressions" notebook tab.

   Figure 4-1. Create Plot Window

   [line_plot.png]

   Into the text boxes just type in expressions where x is the
   independent variable. You can also just give names of
   functions such as cos rather then having to type cos(x). You
   can graph up to ten functions. If you make a mistake and
   Genius cannot parse the input it will signify this with a
   warning icon on the right of the text input box where the
   error occured, as well as giving you an error dialog. You can
   change the ranges of the dependent and independent variables
   in the bottom part of the dialog.

   Pressing the Plot button produces the following graph.

   Figure 4-2. Plot Window

   [line_plot_graph.png]

   From here you can print out the plot, create encapsulated
   postscript or a PNG version of the plot or change the zoom. If
   the dependent axis was not set correctly you can have Genius
   fit it by finding out the extrema of the graphed functions.

   For plotting using the command line see the documentation of
   the LinePlot function.
     _________________________________________________________

4.2. Parametric Plots

   In the create plot window, you can also choose the Parametric
   notebook tab to create two dimensional parametric plots. This
   way you can plot a single parametric function. You can either
   specify the points as x and y, or giving a single complex
   number.

   Figure 4-3. Parametric Plots

   [parametric.png]

   Here is an example of a parametric plot. Similar operations
   can be done on such graphs as can be done on the other line
   plots.

   Figure 4-4. 

   [parametric_graph.png]

   For plotting using the command line see the documentation of
   the LinePlotParametric or LinePlotCParametric function.
     _________________________________________________________

4.3. Surface Plots

   Genius can also plot surfaces. Select the "Surface plot" tab
   in the main notebook of the Create Plot window. Here you can
   specify a single expression which should use either x and y as
   real independent variables or z as a complex variable (where x
   is the real part of z and y is the imaginary part). For
   example to plot the modulus of the cosine function for complex
   parameters, you could enter |cos(z)|. This would be equivalent
   to |cos(x+1i*y)|.

   Figure 4-5. Surface plot

   [surface_graph.png]

   For plotting using the command line see the documentation of
   the SurfacePlot function.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. GEL Basics

   GEL stands for Genius Extension Language. Alternatively it
   also stands for George's Ego Leverage. It is the language you
   use to write programs in Genius. A program in GEL is simply an
   expression that evaluates to a number.
     _________________________________________________________

5.1. Values

   Values in GEL can be numbers, Booleans or strings. Values can
   be used in calculations, assigned to variables and returned
   from functions, among other uses.
     _________________________________________________________

5.1.1. Numbers

   Integers are the first type of number in GEL. Integers are
   written in the normal way.
1234

   Hexidecimal and octal numbers can be written using C notation.
   For example:
0x123ABC
01234

   Or you can type numbers in an arbitrary base using
   <base>\<number>. Digits higher than 10 use letters in a
   similar way to hexidecimal. For example, a number in base 23
   could be written:
23\1234ABCD

   The second type of GEL number is rationals. Rationals are
   simply achieved by dividing two integers. So one could write:
3/4

   to get three quarters. Rationals also accept mixed fraction
   notation. So in order to get one and three tenths you could
   write:
1 3/10

   The next type if number is floating point. These are entered
   in a similar fashion to C notation. You can use E, e or @ as
   the exponent delimiter. Note that using the exponent delimiter
   gives a float even if there is no decimal point in the number.
   Examples:
1.315
7.887e77
7.887e-77
.3
0.3
77e5

   The final type of number in gel is the complex numbers. You
   can enter a complex number as a sum of real and imaginary
   parts. The imaginary part ends with an i. Here are examples of
   entering complex numbers:
1+2i
8.01i
77*e^(1.3i)

   Important

   When entering imaginary numbers, a number must be in front of
   the i. If you use i by itself, Genius will interpret this as
   referring to the variable i. If you need to refer to i by
   itself, use 1i instead.

   In order to use mixed fraction notation with imaginary numbers
   you must have the mixed fraction in parentheses. (i.e., (1
   2/5)i)
     _________________________________________________________

5.1.2. Booleans

   Genius also supports native Boolean values. The two Boolean
   constants are defined as true and false; these identifiers can
   be used like any other variable. You can also use the
   identifiers True, TRUE, False and FALSE as aliases for the
   above.

   At any place where a Boolean expression is expected, you can
   use a Boolean value or any expression that produces either a
   number or a Boolean. If Genius needs to evaluate a number as a
   Boolean it will interpret 0 as false and any other number as
   true.

   In addition, you can do arithmetic with Boolean values. For
   example:
( (1 + true) - false ) * true

   is the same as:
( (true or true) or not false ) and true

   Only addition, subtraction and multiplication are supported.
   If you mix numbers with Booleans in an expression then the
   numbers are converted to Booleans as described above. This
   means that, for example:
1 == true

   always evaluates to true since 1 will be converted to true
   before being compared to true.
     _________________________________________________________

5.1.3. Strings

   Like numbers and Booleans, strings in GEL can be stored as
   values inside variables and passed to functions. You can also
   concatenate a string with another value using the plus
   operator. For example:
a=2+3;"The result is: "+a

   will create the string:
The result is: 5

   You can also use C-like escape sequences such as \n,\t,\b,\a
   and \r. To get a \ or " into the string you can quote it with
   a \. For example:
"Slash: \\ Quotes: \" Tabs: \t1\t2\t3"

   will make a string:
Slash: \ Quotes: " Tabs:        1       2       3

   In addition, you can use the library function string to
   convert anything to a string. For example:
string(22)

   will return
"22"

   Strings can also be compared with ==, != and <=> operators
     _________________________________________________________

5.1.4. Null

   Null is a special value. No operations can be performed on it,
   and nothing is printed when it is returned. Therefore, Null is
   useful when you do not want output from an expression. Null
   can be obtained as an expression when you type . or nothing.

   Example:
x=5;.
x=5;
     _________________________________________________________

5.2. Using Variables

   Syntax:
VariableName

   Example:
genius> e
= 2.71828182846

   To evaluate a variable by itself, just enter the name of the
   variable. This will return the value of the variable. You can
   use a variable anywhere you would normally use a number or
   string. In addition, variables are necessary when defining
   functions that take arguments (see Section 5.3.1).

   Tip Using Tab completion


   You can use Tab completion to get Genius to complete variable
   names for you. Try typing the first few letters of the name
   and pressing Tab.

   Important Variable names are case sensitive


   The names of variables are case sensitive. That means that
   variables named hello, HELLO and Hello are all different
   variables.
     _________________________________________________________

5.2.1. Setting Variables

   Syntax:
<identifier> = <value>
<identifier> := <value>

   Example:
x = 3
x := 3

   To assign to a variable, use the = or := operators. These
   operators set the value of the variable and return the number
   you set, so you can do things like
a = b = 5

   The = and := operators can both be used to set variables. The
   difference between them is that the := operator always acts as
   an assignment operator, whereas the = operator may be
   interpreted as testing for equality when used in a context
   where a Boolean expression is expected.
     _________________________________________________________

5.2.2. Global variables

   Sometimes you'd like to set a global variable from inside a
   function. For this, use the set function. Passing a string or
   a quoted identifier to this function sets the variable
   globally. For example, to set a to the value 3 you could call:
set(`a,3)

   or:
set("a",3)

   Like most programming languages, Genius has two different
   types of variables: local (a variable set inside a function
   will not exist outside the function) and global (doesn't
   matter where you set them).
     _________________________________________________________

5.2.3. Built-in variables

   GEL has a number of built-in `variables', such as e. These are
   widely used constants with a preset value, and they cannot be
   assigned new values. There are a number of other built-in
   variables, such as pi and GoldenRatio. See Section 10.4 for a
   full list.
     _________________________________________________________

5.2.4. Previous result variable

   The Ans and ans variables can be used to get the result of the
   last expression. For example, if you had performed some
   calculation, to add 389 to the result you could do:
Ans+389
     _________________________________________________________

5.3. Using Functions

   Syntax:
FunctionName([argument1, argument2, ...])

   Example:
Factorial(5)
cos(2*pi)

   To evaluate a function, enter the name of the function,
   followed by the arguments (if any) to the function in
   parentheses. This will return the result of applying the
   function to its arguments. The number of arguments to the
   function is, of course, different for each function.

   There are many built-in functions, such as sin, cos and tan.
   You can use the help built-in function to get a list of
   available functions, or see Chapter 10 for a full listing.

   Tip Using Tab completion


   You can use Tab completion to get Genius to complete function
   names for you. Try typing the first few letters of the name
   and pressing Tab.

   Important Function names are case sensitive


   The names of functions are case sensitive. That means that
   functions named dosomething, DOSOMETHING and DoSomething are
   all different functions.
     _________________________________________________________

5.3.1. Defining functions

   Syntax:
function <identifier>(<comma separated arguments>) = <function body>
<identifier> = (`() = <function body>)

   The ` is the backquote character, and signifies an anonymous
   function. By setting it to a variable name you effectively
   define a function.

   A function takes zero or more comma separated arguments, and
   returns the result of the function body. Defining your own
   functions is primarily a matter of convenience; one possible
   use is to have sets of functions defined in GEL files which
   Genius can load in order to make available.

   Example:
function addup(a,b,c) = a+b+c

   then addup(1,4,9) yields 14
     _________________________________________________________

5.3.2. Variable argument lists

   If you include ... after the last argument name in the
   function declaration, then Genius will allow any number of
   arguments to be passed in place of that argument. If no
   arguments were passed then that argument will be set to null.
   Otherwise, it will be a horizontal vector containing all the
   arguments. For example:
function f(a,b...) = b

   Then f(1,2,3) yields [2,3], while f(1) yields null.
     _________________________________________________________

5.3.3. Passing functions to functions

   In Genius, it is possible to pass a function as an argument to
   another function. This can be done using either `function
   nodes' or anonymous functions.

   If you do not enter the parentheses after a function name,
   instead of being evaluated, the function will instead be
   returned as a `function node'. The function node can then be
   passed to another function.

   Example:
function f(a,b) = a(b)+1;
function b(x) = x*x;
f(b,2)

   If you want to pass a function that doesn't exist yet, you can
   use an anonymous function (see Section 5.3.1).

   Syntax:
function(<comma separated arguments>) = <function body>
`(<comma separated arguments>) = <function body>

   Example:
function f(a,b) = a(b)+1;
f(`(x) = x*x,2)
     _________________________________________________________

5.3.4. Operations on functions

   Some functions allow arithmetic operations, and some single
   argument functions such as exp or ln, to operate on the
   function. For example,
exp(sin*cos+4)

   will return a function that does
exp(sin(x)*cos(x)+4)

   This can be useful when quickly defining functions. For
   example to create a function to perform the above operation,
   you can just type:
f = exp(sin*cos+4)

   This can also be used in plotting. For example, to plot sin
   squared you can enter:
LinePlot(sin^2)

   Warning

   Not all functions can be used in this way. In addition, when
   you use a binary operation the functions must take the same
   arguments.
     _________________________________________________________

5.4. Absolute value / Modulus

   You can make an absolute value of something by putting the |'s
   around it.
|a-b|

   In case the expression is a complex number the result will be
   the modulus (distance from the origin). So for example:
|3 * e^(1i*pi)|

   returns 3.
     _________________________________________________________

5.5. Separator

   In GEL if you want to type more than one command you have to
   use the ; operator, which is a way to separate expressions,
   such a combined expression will return whatever is the result
   of the last one, so
3 ; 5

   yields 5.

   This will require some parenthesizing to make it unambiguous
   sometimes, especially if the ; is not the top most primitive.
   This slightly differs from other programming languages where
   the ; is a terminator of statements, whereas in GEL it's
   actually a binary operator. If you are familiar with pascal
   this should be second nature. However genius can let you
   pretend it's a terminator somewhat, if a ";" is found at the
   end of a parenthesis or a block, genius will itself append a
   null node to it as if you would have written ";". This is
   usefull in case you don't want to return a value from say a
   loop, or if you handle the return differently. Note that it
   will slow down the code if it's executed too often as there is
   one more operator involved.
     _________________________________________________________

5.6. Modular evaluation

   Sometimes when working with large numbers, it might be faster
   if results are modded after each calculation. To use it you
   just add "mod <integer>" after the expression.

   Example:
2^(5!) * 3^(6!) mod 5

   You can calculate the inverses of numbers mod some integer by
   just using rational numbers (of course the inverse has to
   exist).

   Examples:
10^-1 mod 101
1/10 mod 101

   You can also do modular evaluation with matrices including
   taking inverses, powers and dividing.

   Example:
A = [1,2;3,4]
B = A^-1 mod 5
A*B mod 5

   This should yield the identity matrix as B will be the inverse
   of A mod 5.

   Some functions such as sqrt or log work in a different way
   when in modulo mode. These will then work like their discrete
   versions working within the ring of integers you selected. For
   example:
genius> sqrt(4) mod 7
=
[2      5]
genius> 2*2 mod 7
= 4

   sqrt will actually return all the possible square roots.
     _________________________________________________________

5.7. List of GEL operators

   As everything in gel is really just an expression, it is
   really just all connected together with operators. Here is a
   list of the operators in GEL.

a;b

          The separator, just evaluates both a and b, but returns
          only the result of b.

a=b

          The assignment operator. This assigns b to a (a must be
          a valid lvalue) (note however that this operator may be
          translated to == if used in a place where boolean
          expression is expected)

a:=b

          The assignment operator. Assigns b to a (a must be a
          valid lvalue). This is different from = because it
          never gets translated to a ==.

|a|

          Absolute value or modulus (if a is a complex number).

          See Mathworld for more information.

a^b

          Exponentiation, raises a to the bth power.

a.^b

          Element by element exponentiation. Raise each element
          of a matrix a to the bth power. Or if b is a matrix of
          the same size as a, then do the operation element by
          element. If a is a number and b is a matrix then it
          creates matrix of the same size as b with a raised to
          all the different powers in b.

a+b

          Addition. Adds two numbers, matrices, functions or
          strings. If you add a string to anything the result
          will just be a string.

a-b

          Subtraction. Subtract two numbers, matrices or
          functions.

a*b

          Multiplication. This is the normal matrix
          multiplication.

a.*b

          Element by element multiplication if a and b are
          matrices.

a/b

          Division.

a./b

          Element by element division.

a\b

          Back division. That is this is the same as b/a.

a.\b

          Element by element back division.

a%b

          The mod operator. This does not turn on the modular
          mode, but just returns the remainder of a/b.

a.%b

          Element by element the mod operator. Returns the
          remaineder after element by element a./b.

a mod b

          Modular evaluation operator. The expression a is
          evaluated modulo b. See Section 5.6. Some functions and
          operators behave differently modulo an integer.

a!

          Factorial operator. This is like 1*...*(n-2)*(n-1)*n.

a!!

          Double factorial operator. This is like
          1*...*(n-4)*(n-2)*n.

a==b

          Equality operator (returns true or false).

a!=b

          Inequality operator, returns true if a does not equal b
          else returns false.

a<>b

          Alternative inequality operator, returns true if a does
          not equal b else returns false.

a<=b

          Less than or equal operator, returns true if a is less
          than or equal to b else returns false.

a>=b

          Greater than or equal operator, returns true if a is
          greater than or equal to b else returns false.

a<=>b

          Comparison operator. If a is equal to b it returns 0,
          if a is less than b it returns -1 and if a is greater
          than b it returns 1.

a and b

          Logical and.

a or b

          Logical or.

a xor b

          Logical xor.

not a

          Logical not.

-a

          Negation operator.

&a

          Variable referencing (to pass a reference to
          something). See Section 6.6.

*a

          Variable dereferencing (to access a referenced
          varible). See Section 6.6.

a'

          Matrix conjugate transpose.

a.'

          Matrix transpose, does not conjugate the entries.

a@(b,c)

          Get element of a matrix in row b and column c. If b, c
          are vectors, then this gets the corresponding rows
          columns or submatrices.

a@(b,)

          Get row of a matrix (or rows if b is a vector).

a@(b,:)

          Same as above.

a@(,c)

          Get column of a matrix (or columns if c is a vector).

a@(:,c)

          Same as above.

a@(b)

          Get an element from a matrix treating it as a vector.
          This will traverse the matrix row-wise.

a:b

          Build a vector from a to b (or specify a row, column
          region for the @ operator). For example to get rows 2
          to 4 of mamtrix A we could do

A@(2:4,)


          as 2:4 will return a vector [2,3,4].

a:b:c

          Build a vector from a to c with b as a step. That is
          for example

genius> 1:2:9
=
`[1     3       5       7       9]

(a)i

          Make a imaginary number (multiply a by the imaginary).
          Note that normally the number i is written as 1i. So
          the above is equal to

(a)*1i


`a

          Quote an identifier so that it doesn't get evaluated.
          Or quote a matrix so that it doesn't get expanded.

   Note

   The @() operator makes the : operator most useful. With this
   you can specify regions of a matrix. So that a@(2:4,6) is the
   rows 2,3,4 of the column 6. Or a@(,1:2) will get you the first
   two columns of a matrix. You can also assign to the @()
   operator, as long as the right value is a matrix that matches
   the region in size, or if it is any other type of value.

   Note

   The comparison operators (except for the <=> operator which
   behaves normally), are not strictly binary operators, they can
   in fact be grouped in the normal mathematical way, e.g.:
   (1<x<=y<5) is a legal boolean expression and means just what
   it should, that is (1<x and x=<y and y<5)

   Note

   The unitary minus operates in a different fashion depending on
   where it appears. If it appears before a number it binds very
   closely, if it appears in front of an expression it binds less
   than the power and factorial operators. So for example -1^k is
   really (-1)^k, but -foo(1)^k is really -(foo(1)^k). So be
   careful how you use it and if in doubt, add parentheses.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Programming with GEL

6.1. Conditionals

   Syntax:
if <expression1> then <expression2> [else <expression3>]

   If else is omitted, then if the expression1 yields 0, NULL is
   returned.

   Examples:
if(a==5)then(a=a-1)
if b<a then b=a
if c>0 then c=c-1 else c=0
a = ( if b>0 then b else 1 )

   Note that = will be translated to == if used inside the
   expression for if, so
if a=5 then a=a-1

   will be interpreted as:
if a==5 then a:=a-1
     _________________________________________________________

6.2. Loops

6.2.1. While loops

   Syntax:
while <expression1> do <expression2>
until <expression1> do <expression2>
do <expression2> while <expression1>
do <expression2> until <expression1>

   These are similiar to other languages, however they return the
   result of the last iteration or NULL if no iteration was done.
   In the boolean expression, = is translated into == just as for
   the if statement.
     _________________________________________________________

6.2.2. For loops

   Syntax:
for <identifier> = <from> to <to> do <body>
for <identifier> = <from> to <to> by <increment> do <body>

   Loop with identifier being set to all values from <from> to
   <to>, optionally using an increment other than 1. These are
   faster, nicer and more compact than the normal loops such as
   above, but less flexible. The identifier must be an identifier
   and can't be a dereference. The value of identifier is the
   last value of identifier, or <from> if body was never
   evaluated. The variable is guaranteed to be initialized after
   a loop, so you can safely use it. Also the <from>, <to> and
   <increment> must be non complex values. The <to> is not
   guaranteed to be hit, but will never be overshot, for example
   the following prints out odd numbers from 1 to 19:
for i = 1 to 20 by 2 do print(i)
     _________________________________________________________

6.2.3. Foreach loops

   Syntax:
  for <identifier> in <matrix> do <body>

   For each element, going row by row from left to right do the
   body. To print numbers 1,2,3 and 4 in this order you could do:
for n in [1,2:3,4] do print(n)

   If you wish to run through the rows and columns of a matrix,
   you can use the RowsOf and ColumnsOf functions which return a
   vector of the rows or columns of the matrix. So,
for n in RowsOf ([1,2:3,4]) do print(n)

   will print out [1,2] and then [3,4].
     _________________________________________________________

6.2.4. Break and continue

   You can also use the break and continue commands in loops. The
   continue continue command will restart the current loop at its
   next iteration, while the break command exits the current
   loop.
while(<expression1>) do (
  if(<expression2>) break
  else if(<expression3>) continue;
  <expression4>
)
     _________________________________________________________

6.3. Sums and products

   Syntax:
sum <identifier> = <from> to <to> do <body>
sum <identifier> = <from> to <to> by <increment> do <body>
sum <identifier> in <matrix> do <body>
prod <identifier> = <from> to <to> do <body>
prod <identifier> = <from> to <to> by <increment> do <body>
prod <identifier> in <matrix> do <body>

   If you substitute for with sum or prod, then you will get a
   sum or a product instead of a for loop. Instead of returning
   the last value, these will return the sum or the product of
   the values respectively.

   If no body is executed (for example sum i=1 to 0 do ...) then
   sum returns 0 and prod returns 1 as is the standard
   convention.
     _________________________________________________________

6.4. Comparison operators

   ==, >=, <=, !=, <>, <, > return true or false.

   != and <> are the same thing and mean "is not equal to".

   Normally = is translated to == if it happens to be somewhere
   where GEL is expecing a condition such as in the if condition.
   For example
if a=b then c
if a==b then c

   are the same thing in GEL. However you should really use == or
   := when you want to compare or assign respectively if you want
   your code to be easy to read and to avoid mistakes.

   All the comparison operators (except for the <=> operator
   which behaves normally), are not strictly binary operators,
   they can in fact be grouped in the normal mathematical way,
   e.g.: (1<x<=y<5) is a legal boolean expression and means just
   what it should, that is (1<x and x=<y and y<5)

   The <=> operator returns -1 if left side is smaller, 0 if both
   sides are equal, 1 if left side is larger.

   To build up logical expressions use the words not, and, or,
   xor.

   "or" and "and" are special beasts as they evaluate their
   arguemnts one by one, so the usual trick for conditional
   evaluation works here as well. (e.g., "1 or a=1" will not set
   a=1 since the first argument was true)
     _________________________________________________________

6.5. Returning

   Sometimes you don't want to return the last thing calculated.
   You may, for example, want to return from a middle of a
   function. In this case, you can use the return keyword. return
   takes one argument, which is the value to be returned.

   Example:
function f(x) = (
  y=1;
  while true do (
    if x>50 then return y;
    y=y+1;
    x=x+1
  )
)
     _________________________________________________________

6.6. References

   GEL contains references with a C like syntax. & references a
   variable and * dereferences a variable. Both can only be
   applied to an identifier, so **a is not legal in GEL.

   Example:
a=1;
b=&a;
*b=2;

   now 'a' contains 2.
function f(x) = x+1;
t=&f;
*t(3)

   gives us 4.
     _________________________________________________________

6.7. Lvalues

   An lvalue is the left hand side of an assignment. In other
   words, an lvalue is what you assign something to. Valid
   lvalues are:

   a
          Identifier. Here we would be setting the varable of
          name a.

   *a
          Dereference of an identifier. This will set whatever
          variable a points to.

   a@(<region>)
          A region of a matrix. Here the region is specified
          normally as with the regular @() operator, and can be a
          single entry, or an entire region of the matrix.

   Examples:
a:=4
*tmp := 89
a@(1,1) := 5
a@(4:8,3) := [1,2,3,4,5]'

   Note that both := and = can be used interchangably. That is
   except if the assignment appears in a condition. It is thus
   always safer to just use := when you mean assignment.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 7. Advanced Programming with GEL

7.1. Error handling

   If you detect an error in your function, you can bail out of
   it. For normal errors, such as wrong types of arguments, you
   can fail to compute the function by adding the empty statement
   bailout. If something went really wrong and you want to
   completely kill the current computation, you can use
   exception.

   Look at lib.gel for some examples.
     _________________________________________________________

7.2. GEL startup procedure

   First the program looks for the installed library file (the
   compiled version lib.cgel) in the installed directory, then it
   looks into the current directory, and then it tries to load an
   uncompiled file called ~/.geniusinit.

   If you ever change the the library its installed place, you'll
   have to first compile it with genius --compile loader.gel >
   lib.cgel
     _________________________________________________________

7.3. Loading programs

   Sometimes you have a larger program that you wrote into a file
   and want to read in that file. In these situations, you have
   two options. You can keep the functions you use most inside
   the ~/.geniusinit file. Or if you want to load up a file in a
   middle of a session (or from within another file), you can
   type load <list of filenames> at the prompt. This has to be
   done on the top level and not inside any function or whatnot,
   and it cannot be part of any expression. It also has a
   slightly different syntax than the rest of genius, more
   similiar to a shell. You can enter the file in quotes. If you
   use the '' quotes, you will get exactly the string that you
   typed, if you use the "" quotes, special characters will be
   unescaped as they are for strings. Example:
load program1.gel program2.gel
load "Weird File Name With SPACES.gel"

   There are also cd, pwd and ls commands built in. cd will take
   one argument, ls will take an argument which is like the glob
   in the unix shell (i.e., you can use wildcards). pwd takes no
   arguments. For example:
cd directory_with_gel_programs
ls *.gel
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 8. Matrices in GEL

8.1. Matrix support

   To enter matrixes use one of the following two syntaxes. You
   can either enter the matrix separating values by commas and
   rows by semicolons, or separating values by tabs (not usually
   easily possible on the console, only in files) and rows by
   returns, or any combination of the two. So to enter a 3x3
   matrix of numbers 1-9 you could do
[1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9]

   or
[1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9]

   or
[1, 2, 3
 4, 5, 6
 7, 8, 9]

   Do not use both ';' and return at once on the same line
   though. Also do not mix tabs and commas. It is just safest to
   use commas as separators.

   You can also use the matrix expansion functionality to enter
   matricies. For example you can do:
a = [ 1, 2, 3
      4, 5, 6
      7, 8, 9]
b = [ a,  10
      11, 12]

   and you should get
[1  2  3  10
 4  5  6  10
 7  8  9  10
 11 11 11 12]

   similiarly you can build matricies out of vectors and other
   stuff like that.

   Another thing is that non-specified spots are initialized to
   0, so
[1, 2, 3
 4, 5
 6]

   will end up being
[1 2 3
 4 5 0
 6 0 0]

   Note

   Be careful about using whitespace and returns for expressions
   inside the [ ] brackets, as they have a slightly different
   meaning and could mess you up.
     _________________________________________________________

8.2. Conjugate transpose and transpose operator

   You can conjugate transpose a matrix by using the ' operator.
   For example:
[1,2,3]*[4,5,6]'

   We transpose the second vector to make matrix multiplication
   possible.

   If you just want to transpose a matrix without conjugating it,
   you would use the .' operator. For example:
[1,2,3]*[4,5,6i].'
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 9. Polynomials in GEL

   Currently Genius can handle polynomials of one variable
   written out as vectors and do some basic operations with them.
   It is planned to expand this support further.
     _________________________________________________________

9.1. Using Polynomials

   Genius can do some things on polynomials. Polynomials in
   Genius are just horizontal vectors with value only nodes. The
   power of the term is the position in the vector, with the
   first position being 0. So,
[1,2,3]

   translates to a polynomial of
1 + 2*x + 3*x^2

   You can add, subtract and multiply polynomials using the
   AddPoly, SubtractPoly and MultiplyPoly functions respectively.
   You can print a polynomial using the PolyToString function.
   For example,
PolyToString([1,2,3],"y")

   gives
3*y^2 + 2*y + 1

   You can also get a function representation of the polynomial
   so that you can evaluate it. This is done by using
   PolyToFunction, which returns an anonymous function which you
   can assign to something.
f = PolyToFunction([0,1,1])
f(2)

   Look at the function table for the rest of polynomial
   functions.

          number of integers between 1 and n relatively prime to
          n.

          See Planetmath or Mathworld for more information.

   ExactDivision

ExactDivision (n,d)

          Return n/d but only if d divides n. If d does not
          divide n then this function returns garbage. This is a
          lot faster for very large numbers than the operation
          n/d, but of course only useful if you know that the
          division is exact.

   Factorize

Factorize (n)

          Return factorization of a number as a matrix. The first
          row is the primes in the factorization (including 1)

          numbers (those that are sums of their factors) up to
          the number 1000 you could do (this is of course very
          inefficent)

for n=1 to 1000 do (
    if MatrixSum (Factors(n)) == 2*n then
        print(n)
)

   FermatFactorization

FermatFactorization (n,tries)

          Attempt fermat factorization of n into (t-s)*(t+s),
          returns t and s as a vector if possible, null
          otherwise. tries specifies the number of tries before
          giving up.

          This is a fairly good factorization if your number is
          the product of two factors that are very close to each
          other.

          using the factor base S. S should be a column of primes

          logarithms base b in F_q (q a prime) for the factor
          base S (where S is a column vector of primes). The logs
          will be precalculated and returned in the second
          column.

          Check a number for being a perfect square. The number
          must be a real integer. Negative integers are of course
          never perfect squares.

   IsPrime

IsPrime (n)

          Tests primality of integers, for numbers less than
          25*10^9 the answer is deterministic (if Riemann
          hypothesis is true). For numbers larger, the
          probability of a false positive depends on
          IsPrimeMillerRabinReps. That is the probability of
          false positive is 1/4 to the power
          IsPrimeMillerRabinReps. The default value of 22 yields
          a probability of about 5.7e-14.

          If false is returned, you can be sure that the number
          is a composite. If you want to be absolutely sure that
          you have a prime you can use MillerRabinTestSure but it
          may take a lot longer.

          See Planetmath or Mathworld for more information.

   IsPrimitiveMod

IsPrimitiveMod (g,q)

          Check if g is primitive in F_q, where q is a prime. If

          Use the Miller-Rabin primality test on n, reps number
          of times. The probability of false positive is
          (1/4)^reps. It is probably usually better to use
          IsPrime since that is faster and better on smaller
          integers.

          See Planetmath or Mathworld for more information.

   MillerRabinTestSure

MillerRabinTestSure (n)

          Use the Miller-Rabin primality test on n with enough
          bases that assuming the Generalized Reimann Hypothesis
          the result is deterministic.

          See Planetmath or Mathworld for more information.

          Return the Moebius mu function evaluated in n. That is,
          it returns 0 if n is not a product of distinct primes
          and (-1)^k if it is a product of k distinct primes.

          See Planetmath or Mathworld for more information.

   NextPrime

NextPrime (n)

          Returns the least prime greater than n. Negatives of
          primes are considered prime and so to get the previous
          prime you can use -NextPrime(-n).

          This uses the GMP's mpz_nextprime which in turn uses
          the probabilistic Miller-Rabin test (See also
          MillerRabinTest). The probability of false positive is
          not tunable, but is low enough for all practical
          purposes.

          through and you don't want to waste memory to store
          them all.

          For example with Combination you would normally write a
          loop like:

for n in Combinations (4,6) do (
  SomeFunction (n)
);

          But with NextCombination you would write something
          like:

n:=[1:4];
do (
  SomeFunction (n)
) while not IsNull(n:=NextCombination(n,6));

Chapter 11. Example programs in GEL

   Here is a function that calculates factorials:
function f(x) = if x <= 1 then 1 else (f(x-1)*x)

   With indentation it becomes:
function f(x) = (
  if x <= 1 then
    1
  else
    (f(x-1)*x)
)

   This is a direct port of the factorial function from the bc
   manpage. The syntax seems similar to bc, but different in that
   in GEL, the last expression is the one that is returned. Using
   the return function instead, it would be:
function f(x) = (
  if (x <= 1) then return (1);
  return (f(x-1) * x)
)

   This is a smaller, nicer, iterative version, that uses the
   product loop:
function f(x) = prod k=1 to x do k

   Here is a larger example, this basically redefines the
   internal ref function to calculate the same thing, but is
   written in GEL:
# Calculate the row-echelon form of a matrix
function MyOwnREF(m) = (
  if not IsMatrix(m) or not IsValueOnly(m) then
    (error("ref: argument not a value only matrix");bailout);
  s := min(rows(m), columns(m));
  i := 1;
  d := 1;
  while d <= s and i <= columns(m) do (

    # This just makes the anchor element non-zero if at
    # all possible
    if m@(d,i) == 0 then (
      j := d+1;
      while j <= rows(m) do (
        if m@(j,i) == 0 then

Chapter 12. Settings

   To configure Genius Math Tool, choose Settings->Preferences.
   There are several basic parameters provided by the calculator
   in addition to the ones provided by the standard library.
   These control how the calculator behaves.

   Note Changing settings with GEL


   Many of the settings in Genius are simply global variables,
   and can be evaluated and assigned to in the same way as normal
   variables. See Section 5.2 about evaluating and assigning to
   variables, and Section 10.3 for a list of settings that can be
   modified in this way.

   As an example, you can set the maximum number of digits in a
   result to 12 by typing:
MaxDigits = 12
     _________________________________________________________

12.1. Output

   Maximum digits to output
          The maximum digits in a result (MaxDigits)

   Results as floats
          If the results should be always printed as floats
          (ResultsAsFloats)

   Floats in scientific notation
          If floats should be in scientific notation
          (ScientificNotation)

   Always print full expressions
          Should we print out full expressions for non-numeric
          return values (longer than a line) (FullExpressions)

   Display errors in a dialog
          If set the errors will be displayed in a seprate
          dialog, if unset the errors will be printed on the
          console.

   Display information messages in a dialog
          If set the information messages will be displayed in a
          seprate dialog, if unset the information messages will
          be printed on the console.

   Maximum errors to display
          The maximum number of errors to return on one
          evaluation (MaxErrors). If you set this to 0 then all
          errors are always returned. Usually if some loop causes
          many errors, then it is unlikely that you will be able
          to make sense out of more than a few of these, so
          seeing a long list of errors is usually not helpful.

   In addition to these preferences, there are some preferences
   that can only be changed by setting them in the workspace
   console. For others that may affect the output see Section
   10.3.

   MixedFractions
          If fractions should be printed as mixed fractions such
          as "1 1/3" rather than "4/3"

   IntegerOutputBase
          The base that will be used to output integers

   OutputStyle
          A string, can be "normal", "latex", "mathml" or "troff"
          and it will effect how matrices (and perhaps other
          stuff) is printed, useful for pasting into documents
     _________________________________________________________

12.2. Precision

   Floating point precision
          The floating point precision in bits (FloatPrecision).
          Note that changing this only affects newly computed
          quantities. Old values stored in variables are
          obviously still in the old precision and if you want to
          have them more precise you will have to recompute them.
          Exceptions to this are the system constants such as pi
          or e.
     _________________________________________________________

12.3. Terminal

   Terminal refers to the console in the workarea.

   Scrollback lines
          Lines of scrollback in the terminal.

   Font
          The font to use on the terminal.

   Black on white
          If to use black on white on the terminal.

   Blinking cursor
          If the cursor in the terminal should blink when the
          terminal is in focus. This can sometimes be annoying
          and it generates idle traffic if you are using Genius
          remotely.
