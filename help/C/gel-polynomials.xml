      Currently &appname; can handle polynomials of one variable written out
      as vectors and do some basic operations with them.  It is planned to
      expand this support further.

&appname; can do some things on polynomials. Polynomials in &appname; are just horizontal vectors with value only nodes. The power of the term is the position in the vector, with the first position being 0. So,
<programlisting>[1,2,3]
</programlisting>
translates to a polynomial of
<programlisting>1 + 2*x + 3*x^2
</programlisting>

You can add, subtract and multiply polynomials using the <command>AddPoly</command>, <command>SubtractPoly</command> and <command>MultiplyPoly</command> functions respectively. You can print a polynomial using the <command>PolyToString</command> function. For example,
<programlisting>PolyToString([1,2,3],"y")
</programlisting>
gives
<programlisting>3*y^2 + 2*y + 1
</programlisting>
You can also get a function representation of the polynomial so that you can evaluate it. This is done by using <command>PolyToFunction</command>, which returns an anonymous function which you can assign to something.
<programlisting>f = PolyToFunction([0,1,1])
f(2)
</programlisting>
Look at the function table for the rest of polynomial functions.
