      <title>Modular evaluation</title>
      <para>
Sometimes when working with large numbers, it might be faster if results are
modded after each calculation.  To use it you just add "mod &lt;integer&gt;" after
the expression.
      </para>

Example:
<programlisting>2^(5!) * 3^(6!) mod 5
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
You can calculate the inverses of numbers mod some integer by just using
rational numbers (of course the inverse has to exist).
      </para>
      <para>
Examples:
<programlisting>10^-1 mod 101
1/10 mod 101
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
You can also do modular evaluation with matrices including taking inverses,
powers and dividing.
      </para>
      <para>
Example:
<programlisting>A = [1,2;3,4]
B = A^-1 mod 5
A*B mod 5
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
This should yield the identity matrix as B will be the inverse of A mod 5.
