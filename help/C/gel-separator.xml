In GEL if you want to type more than one command you have to use
the <literal>;</literal> operator, which is a way to separate expressions,
such a combined expression will return whatever is the result of the last
one, so suppose you type the following:
<programlisting>3 ; 5
</programlisting>
This expression will yield 5.
      </para>
      <para>
This will require some parenthesizing to make it unambiguous sometimes,
especially if the <literal>;</literal> is not the top most primitive. This slightly differs from
other programming languages where the <literal>;</literal> is a terminator of statements, whereas
in GEL it&rsquo;s actually a binary operator. If you are familiar with pascal
this should be second nature. However genius can let you pretend it is a
terminator somewhat, if a <literal>;</literal> is found at the end of a parenthesis or a block,
genius will itself append a null node to it as if you would have written
<literal>;null</literal>.
This is usefull in case you do not want to return a value from say a loop,
or if you handle the return differently. Note that it will slightly slow down
the code if it is executed too often as there is one more operator involved.
