Finally there is the ';' operator, which is a way to separate expressions,
such a combined expression will return whatever is the result of the last
one, so
<programlisting>3 ; 5
</programlisting>
yields 5.

This will require some parenthesizing to make it unambiguous sometimes, especially if the ; is not the top most primitive. This slightly differs from other programming languages where the ; is a terminator of statements, whereas in GEL it&rsquo;s actually a binary operator. If you are familiar with pascal this should be second nature. However genius can let you pretend it&rsquo;s a terminator somewhat, if a ";" is found at the end of a parenthesis or a block, genius will itself append a null node to it as if you would have written ";". This is usefull in case you don&rsquo;t want to return a value from say a loop, or if you handle the return differently. Note that it will slow down the code if it&rsquo;s executed too often as there is one more operator involved.
