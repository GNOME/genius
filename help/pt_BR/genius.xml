<!-- ============= Introduction =============================== -->
  <chapter id="genius-introduction"> 
    <title>Introdução</title> 
    <para lang="en">
	The <application>Genius Mathematics Tool</application> application is a general calculator for use as a desktop
        calculator, an educational tool in mathematics and other STEM fields,
	and has found use in research.  The language used in <application>Genius Mathematics Tool</application> is designed to be
	‘mathematical’ in the sense that it should be ‘what
	you mean is what you get’.  Of course, that is not an
	entirely attainable goal.  <application>Genius Mathematics Tool</application> features rationals, arbitrary
	precision integers and multiple precision floats using the GMP library.
	It handles complex numbers using cartesian notation.  It has good
	vector and matrix manipulation and can handle basic linear algebra.
	The programming language allows user defined functions, variables, and
	parameters.
    </para> 

    <para lang="en">
	<application>Genius Mathematics Tool</application> comes in two versions.  One version is the graphical GNOME
	version, which features an IDE style interface and the ability 
	to plot functions of one or two variables.  Parametric plots of curves
	are also supported.  It can plot slope fields,
	vector fields and draw their solutions.  The plots can be exported
	to several formats.
	The command line version does not require GNOME, but
	does not implement any feature that requires the graphical interface,
	such as plotting
    </para> 

    <para lang="en">
	    Parts of this manual describe the graphical version of the calculator.
	    The language that both versions use is the same, it is simply the
	    graphical features such as plotting that are unique to the GUI version.
    </para>

    <para lang="en">
	    Generally, when some feature of the language (function, operator, etc...)
	    is new in some version past 1.0.5, it is mentioned, but
	    below 1.0.5 you would have to look at the NEWS file.

    <sect1 id="genius-usage-workarea"> 
      <title lang="en">Using the Work Area</title> 

      <para lang="en">
        Normally you interact with the calculator in the <guilabel>Console</guilabel> tab of the
	work area.  If you are running the text only version then the console
	will be the only thing that is available to you.  If you want to use
	<application>Genius Mathematics Tool</application> as a calculator only, just type in your expression in the console, it
	will be evaluated, and the returned value will be printed.
      </para>

      <para lang="en">
	      To evaluate an expression, type it into the <guilabel>Console</guilabel> work area and press enter.
	      Expressions are written in a
language called GEL.  The most simple GEL expressions just looks like
mathematics.  For example
<screen lang="en"><prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>30*70 + 67^3.0 + ln(7) * (88.8/100)</userinput>
</screen>
or
<screen lang="en"><prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>62734 + 812634 + 77^4 mod 5</userinput>
</screen>
or
<screen lang="en"><prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>| sin(37) - e^7 |</userinput>
</screen>
or
<screen lang="en"><prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>sum n=1 to 70 do 1/n</userinput>
</screen>
(Last is the harmonic sum from 1 to 70)
</para>
<para lang="en">
To get a list of functions and commands, type:
<screen lang="en"><prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>help</userinput>
</screen>
If you wish to get more help on a specific function, type:
<screen lang="en"><prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>help FunctionName</userinput>

To view this manual, type:
<screen lang="en"><prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>manual</userinput>

</para>
<para lang="en">
Suppose you have previously saved some GEL commands as a program to a file and
you now want to execute them.
To load this program from the file <filename>path/to/program.gel</filename>,
type
<screen lang="en"><prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>load path/to/program.gel</userinput>
</screen>
<application>Genius Mathematics Tool</application> keeps track of the current directory.
To list files in the current directory type <command>ls</command>, to change directory
do <userinput>cd directory</userinput> as in the UNIX command shell.

    <sect1 id="genius-usage-create-program"> 
      <title lang="en">To Create a New Program </title> 
      <para lang="en">
	      If you wish to enter several more complicated commands, or perhaps write a complicated
	      function using the <link linkend="genius-gel">GEL</link> language, you can create a new
	     program; really just a file with many commands.
      </para>
      <para lang="en">
To start writing a new program, choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New
Program</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. A new tab will appear in the work area. You
can write a <link linkend="genius-gel">GEL</link> program in this work area.
Once you have written your program you can run it by 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Calculator</guimenu><guimenuitem>Run</guimenuitem></menuchoice> (or
the <guilabel>Run</guilabel> toolbar button).
This will execute your program and will display any output on the <guilabel>Console</guilabel> tab.
Executing a program is equivalent of taking the text of the program and
typing it into the console.  The only difference is that this input is done
independent of the console and just the output goes onto the console.
<menuchoice><guimenu>Calculator</guimenu><guimenuitem>Run</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
will always run the currently selected program even if you are on the <guilabel>Console</guilabel>
tab.  The currently selected program has its tab in bold type.  To select a
program, just click on its tab.
      </para>
      <para lang="en">
To save the program you've just written, choose <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
Similarly as in other programs you can choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to save a program that already has

  <!-- ============= GEL ====================================== -->
  <chapter id="genius-gel"> 
    <title lang="en">GEL Basics</title> 

	<para lang="en">
	  GEL stands for Genius Extension Language.  <!-- Alternatively it also
	  stands for George's Ego Leverage. -->  It is the language you use
	  to write programs in Genius. A program in GEL is simply an
	  expression that evaluates to a number, a matrix, or another object
	  in GEL.
	  <application>Genius Mathematics Tool</application> can be used as a simple calculator, or as a
	  powerful theoretical research tool.  The syntax is meant to
	  have as shallow of a learning curve as possible, especially for use
	  as a calculator.
	</para>

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-values">
      <title lang="en">Values</title>

      <para lang="en">
	      Values in GEL can be <link linkend="genius-gel-values-numbers">numbers</link>, <link linkend="genius-gel-values-booleans">Booleans</link>, or <link linkend="genius-gel-values-strings">strings</link>.   GEL also treats 
<link linkend="genius-gel-matrices">matrices</link> as values.
	      Values can be used in calculations, assigned to variables and returned from functions, among other uses.
      </para>

      <sect2 id="genius-gel-values-numbers">
        <title>Números</title>
        <para lang="en">
Integers are the first type of number in GEL. Integers are written in the normal way.
<programlisting lang="en">1234
</programlisting>
Hexadecimal and octal numbers can be written using C notation. For example:
<programlisting lang="en">0x123ABC
01234
</programlisting>
Or you can type numbers in an arbitrary base using <literal>&lt;base&gt;\&lt;number&gt;</literal>. Digits higher than 10 use letters in a similar way to hexadecimal. For example, a number in base 23 could be written:
<programlisting lang="en">23\1234ABCD
</programlisting>
        </para>

        <para lang="en">
The second type of GEL number is rationals. Rationals are simply achieved by dividing two integers. So one could write:
<programlisting lang="en">3/4
</programlisting>
to get three quarters. Rationals also accept mixed fraction notation. So in order to get one and three tenths you could write:
<programlisting lang="en">1 3/10
</programlisting>
        </para>

        <para lang="en">
The next type of number is floating point. These are entered in a similar fashion to C notation. You can use <literal>E</literal>, <literal>e</literal> or <literal>@</literal> as the exponent delimiter. Note that using the exponent delimiter gives a float even if there is no decimal point in the number. Examples:
<programlisting lang="en">1.315
7.887e77
7.887e-77
.3
0.3
77e5
</programlisting>
	When Genius prints a floating point number it will always append a
	<computeroutput>.0</computeroutput> even if the number is whole.  This is to indicate that
	floating point numbers are taken as imprecise quantities.  When a number is written in the
	scientific notation, it is always a floating point number and thus Genius does not
	print the <computeroutput>.0</computeroutput>.
        </para>

        <para lang="en">
The final type of number in GEL is the complex numbers. You can enter a complex number as a sum of real and imaginary parts. To add an imaginary part, append an <literal>i</literal>.  Here are examples of entering complex numbers:
<programlisting lang="en">1+2i
8.01i
77*e^(1.3i)
</programlisting>
        </para>

        <important>
          <para lang="en">
When entering imaginary numbers, a number must be in front of the <literal>i</literal>. If you use <literal>i</literal> by itself, Genius will interpret this as referring to the variable <varname>i</varname>. If you need to refer to <literal>i</literal> by itself, use <literal>1i</literal> instead.
          </para>

          <para lang="en">
In order to use mixed fraction notation with imaginary numbers you must have the mixed fraction in parentheses. (i.e., <userinput>(1 2/5)i</userinput>)
          </para>
        </important>

      </sect2>


      <sect2 id="genius-gel-values-booleans">
        <title>Booleanos</title>
        <para lang="en">
Genius also supports native Boolean values. The two Boolean constants are
defined as <constant>true</constant> and <constant>false</constant>; these
identifiers can be used like any other variable. You can also use the
identifiers <constant>True</constant>, <constant>TRUE</constant>,
<constant>False</constant> and <constant>FALSE</constant> as aliases for the
above.
        </para>
        <para lang="en">
At any place where a Boolean expression is expected, you can use a Boolean
value or any expression that produces either a number or a Boolean. If
Genius needs to evaluate a number as a Boolean it will interpret
0 as <constant>false</constant> and any other number as
<constant>true</constant>.
         </para>
        <para lang="en">
In addition, you can do arithmetic with Boolean values. For example:
<programlisting lang="en">( (1 + true) - false ) * true
</programlisting>
is the same as:
<programlisting lang="en">( (true or true) or not false ) and true
</programlisting>
Only addition, subtraction and multiplication are supported. If you mix numbers with Booleans in an expression then the numbers are converted to Booleans as described above. This means that, for example:
<programlisting lang="en">1 == true
</programlisting>
always evaluates to <constant>true</constant> since 1 will be converted to <constant>true</constant> before being compared to <constant>true</constant>.
        </para>
      </sect2>


      <sect2 id="genius-gel-values-strings">
        <title>Strings</title>
        <para lang="en">
Like numbers and Booleans, strings in GEL can be stored as values inside variables and passed to functions. You can also concatenate a string with another value using the plus operator. For example:
<programlisting lang="en">a=2+3;"The result is: "+a
</programlisting>
will create the string:
<programlisting lang="en">The result is: 5
</programlisting>
You can also use C-like escape sequences such as <literal>\n</literal>,<literal>\t</literal>,<literal>\b</literal>,<literal>\a</literal> and <literal>\r</literal>. To get a <literal>\</literal> or <literal>"</literal> into the string you can quote it with a <literal>\</literal>. For example:
<programlisting lang="en">"Slash: \\ Quotes: \" Tabs: \t1\t2\t3"
</programlisting>
will make a string:
<programlisting lang="en">Slash: \ Quotes: " Tabs: 	1	2	3
</programlisting>
Do note however that when a string is returned from a function, escapes are
quoted, so that the output can be used as input.  If you wish to print the
string as it is (without escapes), use the 
<link linkend="gel-function-print"><function>print</function></link>
or
<link linkend="gel-function-printn"><function>printn</function></link> functions.
        </para>
        <para lang="en">
		In addition, you can use the library function <link linkend="gel-function-string"><function>string</function></link> to convert anything to a string. For example:
<programlisting lang="en">string(22)
</programlisting>
will return
<programlisting lang="en">"22"
</programlisting>
Strings can also be compared with <literal>==</literal> (equal), <literal>!=</literal> (not equal) and <literal>&lt;=&gt;</literal> (comparison) operators
        </para>
      </sect2>


      <sect2 id="genius-gel-values-null">
        <title lang="en">Null</title>
        <para lang="en">
There is a special value called
<constant>null</constant>. No operations can be performed on
it, and nothing is printed when it is returned. Therefore,
<constant>null</constant> is useful when you do not want output from an
expression.  The value <constant>null</constant> can be obtained as an expression when you
type <literal>.</literal>, the constant <constant>null</constant> or nothing.
By nothing we mean that if you end an expression with
a separator <literal>;</literal>, it is equivalent to ending it with a
separator followed by a <constant>null</constant>.
        </para>
        <para lang="en">
Example:
<programlisting lang="en">x=5;.
x=5;
</programlisting>
        </para>
<para lang="en">
Some functions return <constant>null</constant> when no value can be returned
or an error happened.  Also <constant>null</constant> is used as an empty vector
or matrix, or an empty reference.

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-separator">
      <title lang="en">Separator</title>
      <para lang="en">
	      GEL is somewhat different from other languages in how it deals with multiple commands and functions.
	      In GEL you must chain commands together with a separator operator.
That is, if you want to type more than one expression you have to use
the <literal>;</literal> operator in between the expressions.   This is
a way in which both expressions are evaluated and the result of the second one (or the last one
if there is more than two expressions) is returned.
Suppose you type the following:
<programlisting lang="en">3 ; 5
</programlisting>
This expression will yield 5.
      </para>
      <para lang="en">
This will require some parenthesizing to make it unambiguous sometimes,
especially if the <literal>;</literal> is not the top most primitive. This slightly differs from
other programming languages where the <literal>;</literal> is a terminator of statements, whereas
in GEL it’s actually a binary operator. If you are familiar with pascal
this should be second nature. However genius can let you pretend it is a
terminator to some degree.  If a <literal>;</literal> is found at the end of a parenthesis or a block,
genius will append a null to it as if you would have written
<userinput>;null</userinput>.
This is useful in case you do not want to return a value from a loop,
or if you handle the return differently.
      </para>
      <para lang="en">
	      If you are typing expressions in a program file you do not have to add a semicolon.  In this case
	      genius will simply print the return value whenever it executes the expression.  This is the same
	      as when typing on the command line.  However, do note that if you are defining a
	      function, the body of the function is a single expression.  Usually, therefore, if a function body is
	      long, you will need to enclose it in parentheses.

<programlisting lang="en"># This is just a comment

	      Genius implements modular arithmetic.
To use it you just add "mod &lt;integer&gt;" after
the expression.  Example:
<userinput>2^(5!) * 3^(6!) mod 5</userinput>
It could be possible to do modular arithmetic by computing with integers and then modding in the end with
the <literal>%</literal> operator, which simply gives the remainder, but
that may be time consuming if not impossible when working with larger numbers.
For example, <userinput>10^(10^10) % 6</userinput> will simply not work (the exponent
will be too large), while
<userinput>10^(10^10) mod 6</userinput> is instantaneous.  The first expression first tries to compute the integer
<userinput>10^(10^10)</userinput> and then find remainder after division by 6, while the second expression evaluates
everything modulo 6 to begin with.
      </para>
      <para lang="en">
	      The inverses of numbers mod some integer are computed by writing them as
rational numbers (as long as the desired inverse exists, of course).
Examples:
<programlisting lang="en">10^-1 mod 101
1/10 mod 101</programlisting>
Modular evaluation also works with matrices including taking inverses,
powers, and dividing.
Example:
<programlisting lang="en">A = [1,2;3,4]
B = A^-1 mod 5
A*B mod 5</programlisting>
This should yield the identity matrix as B will be the inverse of A mod 5.

      <para lang="en">
Some functions such as
<link linkend="gel-function-sqrt"><function>sqrt</function></link> or
<link linkend="gel-function-log"><function>log</function></link>
work in a different way when in modulo mode.  These will then work like their
discrete versions working within the ring of integers you selected.  For
example:
<programlisting lang="en">genius&gt; sqrt(4) mod 7
=
[2, 5]
genius&gt; 2*2 mod 7
= 4</programlisting>
	<function>sqrt</function> will actually return all the possible square
	roots.
      </para>
      <para lang="en">
	      Do not chain mod operators, simply place it at the end of the computation, all computations in the expression on the left
	      will be carried out in mod arithmetic.  If you place a mod inside
	      a mod, you will get unexpected results.  If you simply want to
	      mod a single number and control exactly when remainders are
	      taken, best to use the <literal>%</literal> operator.  When you
	      need to chain several expressions in modular arithmetic with
	      different divisors, it may be best to just split up the expression into several and use
	      temporary variables to avoid a mod inside a mod.

	     When the numbers involved are floating point numbers, for example

	     even though adding 0.4 to 1.0 five times is actually just slightly
	     more than 3.0 due to the way that floating point numbers are
	     stored in base 2 (there is no 0.4, the actual number stored is
	     just ever so slightly bigger).  The way this is handled is the
	     same as in the for, sum, and prod loops.  If the end is within
	     <userinput>2^-20</userinput> times the step size of the endpoint,
	     the endpoint is used and we assume there were roundoff errors.
	     This is not perfect, but it handles the majority of the cases.
	     This check is done only from version 1.0.18 onwards, so execution
	     of your code may differ on older versions.  If you want to avoid
	     dealing with this issue, use actual rational numbers, possibly
	     using the <function>float</function> if you wish to get floating
	     point numbers in the end.  For example

The @() operator makes the : operator most useful.  With this you can specify regions of a matrix.  So that a@(2:4,6) is the rows 2,3,4 of the column 6. Or a@(,1:2) will get you the first two columns of a matrix. You can also assign to the @() operator, as long as the right value is a matrix that matches the region in size, or if it is any other type of value.

The comparison operators (except for the &lt;=&gt; operator, which behaves normally), are not strictly binary operators, they can in fact be grouped in the normal mathematical way, e.g.: (1&lt;x&lt;=y&lt;5) is a legal boolean expression and means just what it should, that is (1&lt;x and x≤y and y&lt;5)

The unitary minus operates in a different fashion depending on where it
appears.  If it appears before a number it binds very closely, if it appears in
front of an expression it binds less than the power and factorial operators.
So for example <userinput>-1^k</userinput> is really <userinput>(-1)^k</userinput>,
but <userinput>-foo(1)^k</userinput> is really <userinput>-(foo(1)^k)</userinput>.  So
be careful how you use it and if in doubt, add parentheses.

Loop with identifier being set to all values from <literal>&lt;from&gt;</literal> to <literal>&lt;to&gt;</literal>, optionally using an increment other than 1. These are faster, nicer and more compact than the normal loops such as above, but less flexible. The identifier must be an identifier and can't be a dereference. The value of identifier is the last value of identifier, or <literal>&lt;from&gt;</literal> if body was never evaluated. The variable is guaranteed to be initialized after a loop, so you can safely use it.  Also the <literal>&lt;from&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;to&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;increment&gt;</literal> must be non complex values. The <literal>&lt;to&gt;</literal> is not guaranteed to be hit, but will never be overshot, for example the following prints out odd numbers from 1 to 19:
<programlisting lang="en">for i = 1 to 20 by 2 do print(i)
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para lang="en">
		When one of the values is a floating point number, then the
		final check is done to within 2^-20 of the step size.  That is,
		even if we overshoot by 2^-20 times the "by" above, we still execute the last
		iteration.  This way 
<programlisting lang="en">for x = 0 to 1 by 0.1 do print(x)
</programlisting>
does the expected even though adding 0.1 ten times becomes just slightly more than 1.0 due to the way that floating point numbers
are stored in base 2 (there is no 0.1, the actual number stored is just ever so slightly bigger).  This is not perfect but it handles
the majority of the cases.  If you want to avoid dealing with this issue, use actual rational numbers for example:
<programlisting lang="en">for x = 0 to 1 by 1/10 do print(x)
</programlisting>
		This check is done only from version 1.0.16 onwards, so execution of your code may differ on older versions.

	  GEL is a
	  <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28programming%29">
	  dynamically scoped language</ulink>.  We will explain what this
	  means below.  That is, normal variables and functions are dynamically
	  scoped.  The exception are 
	  <link linkend="genius-gel-parameters">parameter variables</link>,
	  which are always global.
	</para>
	<para lang="en">
	  Like most programming languages, GEL has different types
	  of variables.  Normally when a variable is defined in a function,
	  it is visible from that function and from all functions that are
	  called (all higher contexts).  For example, suppose a function
	  <function>f</function> defines a variable <varname>a</varname>
	  and then calls function <function>g</function>.  Then
	  function <function>g</function> can reference
	  <varname>a</varname>.  But once <function>f</function> returns,
	  the variable <varname>a</varname> goes out of scope.
	  For example, the following code will print out 5.
	  The function <function>g</function> cannot be called on the
	  top level (outside <function>f</function> as <varname>a</varname>
	  will not be defined).
<programlisting lang="en">function f() = (a:=5; g());
function g() = print(a);
f();
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para lang="en">
	  If you define a variable inside a function it will override
	  any variables defined in calling functions.  For example,
	  we modify the above code and write:
<programlisting lang="en">function f() = (a:=5; g());
function g() = print(a);
a:=10;
f();
</programlisting>
	  This code will still print out 5.  But if you call
	  <function>g</function> outside of <function>f</function> then
	  you will get a printout of 10.  Note that
	  setting <varname>a</varname>
	  to 5 inside <function>f</function> does not change
	  the value of <varname>a</varname> at the top (global) level,
	  so if you now check the value of <varname>a</varname> it will
	  still be 10.
        </para>
	<para lang="en">
	  Function arguments are exactly like variables defined inside
	  the function, except that they are initialized with the value
	  that was passed to the function.  Other than this point, they are
	  treated just like all other variables defined inside the
	  function.
	</para>
	<para lang="en">
	  Functions are treated exactly like variables.  Hence you can
	  locally redefine functions.  Normally (on the top level) you
	  cannot redefine protected variables and functions.  But locally
	  you can do this.  Consider the following session:
<screen lang="en"><prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>function f(x) = sin(x)^2</userinput>
= (`(x)=(sin(x)^2))
<prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>function f(x) = sin(x)^2</userinput>

<prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>function g(x) = ((function sin(x)=x^10);f(x))</userinput>
= (`(x)=((sin:=(`(x)=(x^10)));f(x)))
<prompt>genius&gt; </prompt><userinput>g(10)</userinput>
= 1e20
</screen>
	</para>
	<para lang="en">
	  Functions and variables defined at the top level are
	  considered global.  They are visible from anywhere.  As we
	  said the following function <function>f</function>
	  will not change the value of <varname>a</varname> to 5.
<programlisting lang="en">a=6;
function f() = (a:=5);
f();
</programlisting>
	  Sometimes, however, it is necessary to set
a global variable from inside a function.  When this behavior is needed,
use the
<link linkend="gel-function-set"><function>set</function></link> function. Passing a string or a quoted identifier to
this function sets the variable globally (on the top level).
For example, to set
<varname>a</varname> to the value 3 you could call:
<programlisting lang="en">set(`a,3)
</programlisting>
or:
<programlisting lang="en">set("a",3)
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para lang="en">
	  The <function>set</function> function always sets the toplevel

	  So to recap in a more technical language:  Genius operates with
	  different numbered contexts.  The top level is the context 0
	  (zero).  Whenever a function is entered, the context is raised,
	  and when the function returns the context is lowered.  A function
	  or a variable is always visible from all higher numbered contexts.
	  When a variable was defined in a lower numbered context, then
	  setting this variable has the effect of creating a new local
	  variable in the current context number and this variable
	  will now be visible from all higher numbered contexts.

	<para lang="en">
	  There are also true local variables that are not seen from

	You pass a reference to a variable to a function, and the function

       <title lang="en">Returning Functions</title>
	<para lang="en">
	  It is possible to return functions as value.  This way you can
	  build functions that construct special purpose functions according
	  to some parameters.  The tricky bit is what variables does the
	  function see.  The way this works in GEL is that when a function
	  returns another function, all identifiers referenced in the
	  function body that went out of scope
	  are prepended a private dictionary of the returned
	  function.  So the function will see all variables that were in
	  scope
	  when it was defined.  For example, we define a function that
	  returns a function that adds 5 to its argument.
<programlisting lang="en">function f() = (
  k = 5;
  `(x) = (x+k)
)
</programlisting>
	  Notice that the function adds <varname>k</varname> to
	  <varname>x</varname>.  You could use this as follows.
<programlisting lang="en">g = f();
g(5)
</programlisting>
	  And <userinput>g(5)</userinput> should return 10.
        </para>
	<para lang="en">
	  One thing to note is that the value of <varname>k</varname>
	  that is used is the one that's in effect when the
	  <function>f</function> returns.  For example:
<programlisting lang="en">function f() = (
  k := 5;
  function r(x) = (x+k);
  k := 10;
  r
)
</programlisting>
	  will return a function that adds 10 to its argument rather than
	  5.  This is because the extra dictionary is created only when
	  the context
	  in which the function was defined ends, which is when the function
	  <function>f</function> returns.  This is consistent with how you
	  would expect the function <function>r</function> to work inside
	  the function <function>f</function> according to the rules of
	  scope of variables in GEL.  Only those variables are added to the
	  extra dictionary that are in the context that just ended and
	  no longer exists.  Variables
	  used in the function that are in still valid contexts will work
	  as usual, using the current value of the variable.
	  The only difference is with global variables and functions.
	  All identifiers that referenced global variables at time of
	  the function definition are not added to the private dictionary.
	  This is to avoid much unnecessary work when returning functions
	  and would rarely be a problem.  For example, suppose that you
	  delete the "k=5" from the function <function>f</function>,
	  and at the top level you define <varname>k</varname> to be
	  say 5.  Then when you run <function>f</function>, the function
	  <function>r</function> will not put <varname>k</varname> into
	  the private dictionary because it was global (toplevel)
	  at the time of definition of <function>r</function>.
	</para>
	<para lang="en">
	  Sometimes it is better to have more control over how variables
	  are copied into the private dictionary.  Since version 1.0.7,
	  you can specify which
	  variables are copied into the private dictionary by putting
	  extra square brackets after the arguments with the list of
	  variables to be copied separated by commas.
	  If you do this, then variables are
	  copied into the private dictionary at time of the function
	  definition, and the private dictionary is not touched afterwards.
	  For example
<programlisting lang="en">function f() = (
  k := 5;
  function r(x) [k] = (x+k);
  k := 10;
  r
)
</programlisting>
	  will return a function that when called will add 5 to its
	  argument.  The local copy of <varname>k</varname> was created
	  when the function was defined.
	</para>
	<para lang="en">
	  When you want the function to not have any private dictionary
	  then put empty square brackets after the argument list.  Then
	  no private dictionary will be created at all.  Doing this is
	  good to increase efficiency when a private dictionary is not
	  needed or when you want the function to lookup all variables
	  as it sees them when called.  For example suppose you want
	  the function returned from <function>f</function> to see
	  the value of <varname>k</varname> from the toplevel despite
	  there being a local variable of the same name during definition.
	  So the code
<programlisting lang="en">function f() = (
  k := 5;
  function r(x) [] = (x+k);
  r
);
k := 10;
g = f();
g(10)
</programlisting>
	  will return 20 and not 15, which would happen if
	  <varname>k</varname> with a value of 5 was added to the private
	  dictionary.

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-true-local-variables">
      <title lang="en">True Local Variables</title>
      <para lang="en">
	When passing functions into other functions, the normal scoping of
	variables might be undesired.  For example:
<programlisting lang="en">k := 10;
function r(x) = (x+k);
function f(g,x) = (
  k := 5;
  g(x)
);
f(r,1)
</programlisting>
	you probably want the function <function>r</function>
	when passed as <function>g</function> into <function>f</function>
	to see <varname>k</varname> as 10 rather than 5, so that
	the code returns 11 and not 6.  However, as written, the function
	when executed will see the <varname>k</varname> that is
	equal to 5.  There are two ways to solve this.  One would be
	to have <function>r</function> get <varname>k</varname> in a
	private dictionary using the square bracket notation section
	<link linkend="genius-gel-returning-functions">Returning
	Functions</link>.
      </para>
      <para lang="en">
	But there is another solution.  Since version 1.0.7 there are
	true local variables.  These are variables that are visible only
	from the current context and not from any called functions.
	We could define <varname>k</varname> as a local variable in the
	function <function>f</function>.  To do this add a
	<command>local</command> statement as the first statement in the
	function (it must always be the first statement in the function).
	You can also make any arguments be local variables as well.
	That is,
<programlisting lang="en">function f(g,x) = (
  local g,x,k;
  k := 5;
  g(x)
);
</programlisting>
	Then the code will work as expected and prints out 11.
	Note that the <command>local</command> statement initializes
	all the referenced variables (except for function arguments) to
	a <constant>null</constant>.
      </para>
      <para lang="en">
	If all variables are to be created as locals you can just pass an
	asterisk instead of a list of variables.  In this case the variables
	will not be initialized until they are actually set.
	So the following definition of <function>f</function>
	will also work:
<programlisting lang="en">function f(g,x) = (
  local *;
  k := 5;
  g(x)
);
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para lang="en">
	It is good practice that all functions that take other functions
	as arguments use local variables.  This way the passed function 
	does not see implementation details and get confused.

      matrix manipulation and linear algebra functions.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="genius-gel-matrix-support">
      <title lang="en">Entering Matrices</title>
      <para lang="en">
To enter matrices, you can use one of the following two syntaxes. You can either enter
the matrix on one line, separating values by commas and rows by semicolons.  Or you
can enter each row on one line, separating
values by commas.
You can also just combine the two methods.
So to enter a 3x3 matrix
of numbers 1-9 you could do
<programlisting lang="en">[1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9]
</programlisting>
or
<programlisting lang="en">[1, 2, 3
 4, 5, 6
 7, 8, 9]
</programlisting>
Do not use both ';' and return at once on the same line though.
      </para>

      <para lang="en">
You can also use the matrix expansion functionality to enter matrices.
For example you can do:
<programlisting lang="en">a = [ 1, 2, 3
      4, 5, 6
      7, 8, 9]
b = [ a,  10
      11, 12]
</programlisting>
and you should get
<programlisting lang="en">[1,   2,  3, 10
 4,   5,  6, 10
 7,   8,  9, 10
 11, 11, 11, 12]
</programlisting>
similarly you can build matrices out of vectors and other stuff like that.
      </para>

      <para lang="en">
Another thing is that non-specified spots are initialized to 0, so
<programlisting lang="en">[1, 2, 3
 4, 5
 6]
</programlisting>
will end up being
<programlisting lang="en">
[1, 2, 3
 4, 5, 0
 6, 0, 0]
</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para lang="en">
	When matrices are evaluated, they are evaluated and traversed row-wise.  This is just
	like the <literal>M@(j)</literal> operator, which traverses the matrix row-wise.

      <note>
        <para lang="en">
Be careful about using returns for expressions inside the
<literal>[ ]</literal> brackets, as they have a slightly different meaning
there.  You will start a new row.

You can conjugate transpose a matrix by using the <literal>'</literal> operator.  That is
the entry in the
<varname>i</varname>th column and the <varname>j</varname>th row will be
the complex conjugate of the entry in the
<varname>j</varname>th column and the <varname>i</varname>th row of the original matrix.
 For example:
<programlisting lang="en">[1,2,3]*[4,5,6]'
</programlisting>
We transpose the second vector to make matrix multiplication possible.
If you just want to transpose a matrix without conjugating it, you would
use the <literal>.'</literal> operator.  For example:
<programlisting lang="en">[1,2,3]*[4,5,6i].'
</programlisting>
      </para>
	<para lang="en">
	  Note that normal transpose, that is the <literal>.'</literal> operator, is much faster
	  and will not create a new copy of the matrix in memory.  The conjugate transpose does
	  create a new copy unfortunately.
	  It is recommended to always use the <literal>.'</literal> operator when working with real

	The linear algebra routines implemented in GEL do not currently come

	For example, it is pointless to compute the rank and nullspace of a
floating point matrix since for all practical purposes, we need to consider the
matrix as having some slight errors.  You are likely to get a different result
than you expect.  The problem is that under a small perturbation every matrix
is of full rank and invertible.  If the matrix however is of rational numbers,
then the rank and nullspace are always exact.

the given linear subspace.

	It should be noted that Genius can remember certain properties of a
matrix.  For example, it will remember that a matrix is in row reduced form.
If many calls are made to functions that internally use row reduced form of
the matrix, we can just row reduce the matrix beforehand once.  Successive
calls to <link linkend="gel-function-rref"><function>rref</function></link> will be very fast.

Currently
polynomials in one variable are just horizontal vectors with value only nodes.
The power of the term is the position in the vector, with the first position
being 0. So,
<programlisting lang="en">[1,2,3]
</programlisting>
translates to a polynomial of
<programlisting lang="en">1 + 2*x + 3*x^2
</programlisting>
      </para>

You can add, subtract and multiply polynomials using the

<link linkend="gel-function-SubtractPoly"><function>SubtractPoly</function></link>, and
<link linkend="gel-function-MultiplyPoly"><function>MultiplyPoly</function></link> functions respectively.
You can print a polynomial using the
<link linkend="gel-function-PolyToString"><function>PolyToString</function></link>
function.
For example,
<programlisting lang="en">PolyToString([1,2,3],"y")
</programlisting>
gives
<programlisting lang="en">3*y^2 + 2*y + 1
</programlisting>
You can also get a function representation of the polynomial so that you can
evaluate it. This is done by using
<link linkend="gel-function-PolyToFunction"><function>PolyToFunction</function></link>,

returns an anonymous function.
<programlisting lang="en">f = PolyToFunction([0,1,1])

  <!-- ============= GEL examples ============================= -->
  <chapter id="genius-gel-example-programs">
    <title lang="en">Example Programs in GEL</title>

    <para lang="en">
Here is a function that calculates factorials:
<programlisting lang="en"><![CDATA[function f(x) = if x <= 1 then 1 else (f(x-1)*x)
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
With indentation it becomes:
<programlisting lang="en"><![CDATA[function f(x) = (
  if x <= 1 then
    1
  else
    (f(x-1)*x)
)
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
This is a direct port of the factorial function from the <application>bc</application> manpage. The syntax seems similar to <application>bc</application>, but different in that in GEL, the last expression is the one that is returned. Using the <literal>return</literal> function instead, it would be:
<programlisting lang="en"><![CDATA[function f(x) = (
  if (x <= 1) then return (1);
  return (f(x-1) * x)
)
]]></programlisting>
    </para>

    <para lang="en">
By far the easiest way to define a factorial function would be using
the product loop as follows.  This is not only the shortest and fastest,
but also probably the most readable version.
<programlisting lang="en">function f(x) = prod k=1 to x do k
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para lang="en">
Here is a larger example, this basically redefines the internal
<link linkend="gel-function-ref"><function>ref</function></link> function to calculate the row echelon form of a
matrix.  The function <function>ref</function> is built in and much faster,
but this example demonstrates some of the more complex features of GEL.
<programlisting lang="en"><![CDATA[# Calculate the row-echelon form of a matrix

  if not IsMatrix(m) or not IsValueOnly(m) then

  s := min(rows(m), columns(m));
  i := 1;
  d := 1;
  while d <= s and i <= columns(m) do (

    # This just makes the anchor element non-zero if at
    # all possible
    if m@(d,i) == 0 then (
      j := d+1;
      while j <= rows(m) do (
