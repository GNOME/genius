****************************************************************************

Requirements:
	- lex (tested under flex)
	- yacc (tested under bison -y)
	- gmp (relatively new one required, tested with 4.1)
	  - mpfr (optional but highly recommended)
                 (part of gmp, but must be enabled)
	- glib 2.x
	- gtk+ 2.x (at least 2.4 is recommended)
	- gnome libs
All except gmp seem to be pretty much standard or Linux systems, and even
on most other platforms.

It's under GPL so read COPYING
