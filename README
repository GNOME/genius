Genius Calculator
=================

Genius calculator is a general purpose calculator and mathematics tool
with many features.

For a manual read help/genius.txt (or see the manual in the gnome
help browser).

****************************************************************************

Requirements:
	- lex (tested under flex)
	- yacc (tested under bison -y)
	- gmp (relatively new one required)
	- mpfr (relatively new one)
	- glib 2.41.1
And for the GNOME frontend you need:
	- gtk+ 3.21.4
	- vte 2.91
	- gtksourceview4 3.99.7

If you want to compile without the GNOME frontend, try the
  --disable-gnome
argument to the ./configure script.  You will miss out on the GUI stuff
(which includes the plotting) but you can use all the rest nicely.

It's under GPL so read COPYING

Note: the gtkextra/ directory which includes the plotting widgetry is
copyright: Adrian E. Feiguin <feiguin@ifir.edu.ar> and is under LGPL.  When
GtkExtra is actually released, stable, free of bugs, widely deployed and all
that it will become a requirement rather then being included like this.  This
seems very unlikely at this time.
