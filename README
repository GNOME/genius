Genius Calculator
=================

Genius calculator is a general purpose calculator and mathematics tool
with many features.

For a manual, you can open a manual from the menu in the graphical version or
you can type "manual" and enter in the genius command prompt.  It will launch a
browser with the manual (a text based browser if running the terminal version
of genius).  Alternatively you can read help/genius.txt for a text conversion
of the manual.

Requirements:
	- lex (tested under flex)
	- yacc (tested under bison -y)
	- gmp (relatively new one required)
	- mpfr (relatively new one)
	- glib 2.41.1
And for the GNOME frontend you need:
	- gtk+ 3.21.4
	- vte 2.91
	- gtksourceview4 3.99.7

If you want to compile without the GNOME frontend, try the
  --disable-gnome
argument to the ./configure script.  You will miss out on the GUI stuff
(which includes the plotting) but you can use all the rest nicely.

It's under GPL so read COPYING

Note: the gtkextra/ directory which includes the plotting widgetry is
copyright: Adrian E. Feiguin <feiguin@ifir.edu.ar> and is under LGPL.
It is somewhat modified from the stock version.
