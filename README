****************************************************************************

Requirements:
	- lex (tested under flex)
	- yacc (tested under bison -y)
	- gmp (relatively new one required, tested with 4.1)
	- glib
	- gtk+
	- gnome libs
All except gmp seem to be pretty much standard or Linux systems, and even
on most other platforms.

It's under GPL so read COPYING
