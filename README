Genius Calculator
=================

Genius calculator is a general purpose calculator and mathematics tool
with many features.

For a manual read help/C/genius.txt (or see the manual in the gnome
help browser).

****************************************************************************

Requirements:
	- lex (tested under flex)
	- yacc (tested under bison -y)
	- gmp (relatively new one required)
	- mpfr (relatively new one)
	- glib 2.x
And for the GNOME frontend you need:
	- gtk+ 2.x (2.4 or greater is recommended, but any 2.x should work)
	- gnome libs
	- gtksourceview (optional but recommended)
All except gmp seem to be pretty much standard or Linux systems, and even
on most other platforms.

If you want to compile without the GNOME frontend, try the
  --disable-gnome
argument to the ./configure script.  You will miss out on the GUI stuff
(which includes the plotting) but you can use all the rest nicely.

It's under GPL so read COPYING

Note: the gtkextra/ directory which includes the plotting widgetry is
copyright: Adrian E. Feiguin <feiguin@ifir.edu.ar> and is under LGPL.  When
GtkExtra is actually released, stable, widely deployed and all that it will
become a requirement rather then being included like this.
