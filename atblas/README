1. Introduction
---------------

The  BLAS (Basic  Linear Algebra  Subprograms)  are routines
that provide  standard building blocks  for performing basic
vector  and  matrix operations.   The  reference  BLAS is  a
freely--available software package.

  This distribution  repackages the original  BLAS and CBLAS
source  code   under  the  configuration   and  installation
framework  provided  by  the  GNU Autotools.   It  was  last
updated with BLAS 2011/04/19 and CBLAS 2011/01/20.

  There are three levels of BLAS operations:

* Level 1, vector operations:

    Y = alpha X + Y

  where X and Y are vectors and alpha is a scalar.

* Level 2, matrix-vector operations:

    Y = alpha A X + beta Y

  where X and  Y are vectors, alpha and  beta are scalar and
  A is a matrix.

* Level 3, matrix-matrix operations:

    D = alpha A B + C

  where A, B, C and D are matrices and alpha is a scalar.


2. License
----------

The reference  BLAS is a  freely-available software package.
It is available from Netlib  via anonymous FTP and the World
Wide Web.   Thus, it can be included  in commercial software
packages (and has been).  We  only ask that proper credit be
given to the authors.

  Like  all   software,  it  is  copyrighted.    It  is  not
trademarked, but we do ask  the following: if you modify the
source for these routines we ask that you change the name of
the routine and comment the changes made to the original.

  If a modification is done  it is the responsibility of the
person who modified the routine to provide support.


3. Install
----------

Do this:

    $ cd atblas-0.1.0
    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ cd "=build"

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The Makefile supports  the DESTDIR environment variable to
install files in a  temporary location, example: to see what
will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/atblas

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/atblas


4. Usage
--------
