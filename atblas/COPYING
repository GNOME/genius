The reference BLAS is a freely-available software package.  It is
available from Netlib  via anonymous FTP and the  World Wide Web.
Thus, it can be included in commercial software packages (and has
been).  We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors.

  Like all  software, it is copyrighted.  It  is not trademarked,
but we do  ask the following: if you modify  the source for these
routines  we ask  that you  change the  name of  the  routine and
comment the changes made to the original.

  If  a modification  is done  it  is the  responsibility of  the
person who modified the routine to provide support.
