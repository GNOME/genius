Changes to 0.7.4

* Primitive symbolic derivatives of some expressions
* Parametric plots
* Accepts identifiers as well as functions in a number of places
* SYNTAX: When adding a scalar to a square matrix "A+x" now acts as "A+x*I"
  rather then A+x*ones.  If you want to add a scalar to every element of a
  matrix, use .+ and .- operators.  Behaviour is element by element for vectors
  (1 by n or n by 1 matrices)
* SYNTAX: 'call' now binds tighter to allow "x = f call (x)" to act like
  x=(f(x)) rather then (x=f)(x)
* SYNTAX: allow "identifier + string" which creates a string
* Added functions: IsFunctionOrIdentifier, ComposePower, Derivative,
  SymbolicDerivative SymbolicDerivativeTry, SymbolicNthDerivative,
  SymbolicNthDerivativeTry, SymbolicTaylorApproximationFunction
* Many minor fixes

Changes to 0.7.3

* Update to mpfr 2.1.1
* Documentation update, document the plotting functions for example.
* Blinking cursor can now be turned off in gnome-genius
* Set default precision to 128 bits.  Who needs 256 can set it in the
  preferences.  Also save/restore the precision
* Add LinePlotClear, LinePlotDrawLine functions to allow drawing arbitrary
  lines and to allow a way to do parametric plots until that functionality
  is actually added
* Added: NewtonsMethodPoly, wait
* Lots of work on the internal number structure to make it faster/more
  memory efficient and to fix some possible bugs/issues
* Fix float formatting bug that sometimes caused hangs and crashes
* Fix large leak on element by element operations
* Fix compilation with external mpfr
* Bunch of other little bugs/issues fixed.
* Translation updates (Adam Weinberger, Miloslav Trmac, David Lodge,
  Petrecca Michele, Vincent van Adrighem, Tino Meinen, Jan Moren)

Changes to 0.7.2

* The manual is in Docbook and has been greatly updated (Kai Willadsen, me)
  there is even the beginnings of a detailed function reference with links
  to Planetmath and Mathworld.
* Better help integration
* We have an icon (Eugenia Loli-Queru)
* Include internal MPFR which is more recent and less buggy then ones
  found on most people's systems (this makes it easier to compile genius
  too)
* Added: CompositeSimpsonsRuleTolerance, GaussFunction, GaussDistribution,
  BernoulliNumber, ExactDivision, MoebiusMu (Alessio Frusciante), 
  IsNonNegativeInteger, LUDecomposition (David W. Hutchison),
  EulersMethod, RungeKutta
* Fixed, round, ceil, trunc and Hofstadter
* Few more functions now apply over matrices with matrix arguments

  strings are used
* When new references are encountered where the variable does not exist we
  create the variable in the current context
* On the plot window use "y=" as a label to indicate what goes in the text
  boxes
* "New" toolbar item
* Fix crashes on non-number matrix multiplies
* Bunch of minor fixes all over
* Help texts are being translated now
* Translation updates (Adam Weinberger, David Lodge, Miloslav Trmac,
  Amanpreet Singh Alam, Raphael Higino, Vincent van Adrighem,
  Tino Meinen, Jan Morén, Laurent Dhima, Takeshi AIHANA,
  Francisco Javier F. Serrador)

Changes to 0.7.1

* Run EPS output through ps2epsi if it's there which adds a bitmap preview,
  even though this bitmap preview is fairly crappy
* Add PNG export for plots
* Remove some parenthesis from output where they are not needed
* SYNTAX: InfiniteSum, InfiniteSum2, InfiniteProduct, InfiniteProduct2,
  now no longer take the tolerance argument and behaviour is controlled
  by the SumProductTolerance, SumProductSFS and SumProductNumberOfTries like
  other limits and they return null when limit can't seem to be found
* Add: NumericalLeftDerivative, NumericalRightDerivative
* Fix the NumericalLimitAtInfinity function and its use and with that fix
  NDerivative (which is now an alias for NumericalDerivative), IsContinuous,
  IsDifferentiable, Limit, LeftLimit, RightLimit
* Fix the specfile and custom CFLAGS are added after the default ones
  (Florin Andrei, me)
* LinePlot and SurfacePlot no longer crash when called without arguments
* Fix EPS/PS export for older gtk
* Fixup compilation of GtkExtra-2 with gcc 3.4
* Bunch of "optimizations" and minor fixes

Changes to 0.7.0

* Replaced plotting with the plotting widget from GtkExtra-2 (private
  copy included, no new dependency), this has several new implications:
 - Plots can be printed or exported to PS or EPS
 - 3D surface plots are supported
* SYNTAX: Native boolean type, true/false are the constants and
  added IntegerFromBoolean and IsBoolean functions.  Should still
  be source compatible
* Fixed saving files warnings about existing files and fixed bad
  warning on loading files
* StandardDeviation now works
* sin,cos,sinh,cosh now work correctly with complex arguments
* Some memory profiling.  Allocate internal structures in long
  continuous blocks and further fixup the engine to be nicer with
  separator nodes which can now take a lot of arguments and really whack
  the result of all but the last expressions at once.
* Work around a mpfr problem when it could return a negative value
  for rand()
* Translation updates (Estevao Samuel Procopio, Vincent van Adrighem,
  Adam Weinberger, Miloslav Trmac, Laurent Dhima, David Lodge,
  Gustavo Maciel Dias Vieira, Raphael Higino, Gareth Owen)

Changes to 0.6.1

* On undefined identifier error, genius gives you close suggestions
* Black on white mode for the console for those that can't see white
  on black so well.
* More UTF-8 cleanup so other languages should work now
* More fun with font sizes and try to normally deduce the font size for the
  console from the theme font size on startup.  Also don't write the font
  as a preference until it's explicitly set
* Accept file drops and open those files
* Use gnome-vfs for opening and saving files (not for load and run yet)
* Mime stuff so that you can open .gel files from nautilus
* Somewhat nicer display of real fractions
* New functions: cis
* The functions promised in 0.6.0 weren't actually added, this affects:
  Argument, arg, Arg, MoebiusDiskMapping, MoebiusMapping,
  MoebiusMappingInftyToOne, MoebiusMappingInftyToZero,
  MoebiusMappingInftyToInfty.
* When we complain about uninitialized functions/variables, give suggestions
* Fix "number <=> string"
* Some code cleanup
* MacOSX install instructions in INSTALL.MacOSX (Linc Davis)
* Other minor fixes

  compile with older gtk
* Some fixes in case GTK+ 2.4 is used
* Allow compilation without GNOME to get the barebones command line
  version
* SYNTAX: Allow some arithmetic operations on functions, as well as passing
  functions to a few select 1 argument functions such as exp or ln, for
  example: exp(sin) returns a function which does exp(sin(x)) and
  sin^2 returns a function that does sin(x)^2
* SYNTAX: New operator := which acts just like = but is never translated
  to ==
* SYNTAX: e^x now translated to exp(x) for better precision (and should be
  teeny bit faster too)
* Optimize/cleanup the mp wrapper code which on my tests can gain something
  like 40% improvement on code that does lots of handling of smaller integers.
* Add PoissonKernel, DirichletKernel, FejerKernel, MoebiusDiskMapping,
  MoebiusMapping, MoebiusMappingInftyToOne, MoebiusMappingInftyToZero
  and MoebiusMappingInftyToInfty

* Fix compilation of parameters
* Fix interruption with ^C
* Lots of other minor fixes
* Documentation updates
* Translation updates (Kostas Papadimas, Petrow Velonis, Vincent van Adrighem,
  Tino Meinen, Danilo Segan, Miloslav Trmac, Robert Sedak, Alastair McKinstry,
  Guntupalli Karunakar, Christophe Merlet, Sebastien Bacher)

Changes to 0.5.7

* Add ErrorFunction (erf), InfiniteProduct, InfiniteProduct2
* Allow large integer powers of 1,-1,1i,-1i and do it very fast
* Be nicer with integer powers of pure imaginary numbers
* mpfr seems broken in 4.1.2 causing something like 0.1^(-1.0) to come out

  are correct.
* Fix warnings on Kernel([0])
* Don't use DEPRECATED defines to allow compiling with newer gtk+

* Several leaks fixed
* Several uninitialized data usage fixed
* Tolerances are floats, add aliases 'Sign' and
  'AbsoluteValue' and add the 'Identity' function
* Lots of internal cleanup including not using deprecated
  stuff.

  (both performance and memory usage)
* Some build fixes
* Fix systems without wordexp (FreeBSD ports)
* Allow loading programs from the command line
  to gnome-genius

  Vincent van Adrighem, Pablo Gonzalo del Campo,
  Francisco Javier F. Serrador, Duarte Loreto, Christian Rose,
  Guntupalli Karunakar, Wang Jian, Mai Hao Hui, Metin Amiroff,
  Jordi Mallach, Xavier Conde Rueda)

Changes to 0.5.5

Note the syntax changes marked with 'SYNTAX:'

* Fix quite a few DOH! errors in the GUI it should now be usable to
  actually edit and save file and all that
* Also print the number line in the status box, this makes it much easier
  to find parse errors.
* Add SqrtModPrime, IsPrimitiveModWithPrimeFactors,
  SilverPohligHellmanWithFactorization
* SYNTAX: use SqrtModPrime when sqrt is called in mod context (only if the
  modulo is a prime, otherwise we print an error)
* Other minor fixes.
* Some new translations apparently too (Swedish by Christian Rose)

Changes to 0.5.4

Note the syntax changes marked with 'SYNTAX:'

* The GUI now allows editing program files and running them directly from
  the gui.
* SYNTAX: If "log" is used in mod environment it acts as DiscreteLog
* IsEven and IsOdd are now internal and fast
* Use MPFR (if available) for log10 and log2, and add lg as an alias to
  log2
* SYNTAX: Use GMP for the MillerRabinTest and implement StrongPseudoprimeTest,
  IsPrime, and MillerRabinTestSure internally, remove IsPrimeLoopMax and
  PrimeProbabilityEpsilon, MillerRabinTest takes the number of reps to do
  and not the epsilon and there is IsPrimeMillerRabinReps parameter, also
  remove IsPrimeProbability
* SYNTAX: Snarf the Pollard-Rho implementation from GMP examples and use it
  for Factorize.  Whack FactorizeLoopMax
* Use MPFR for EulerConstant if available
* Added MillerRabinTestSure, StringToASCII, ASCIIToString, AlphabetToString,
  StringToAlphabet, LeastAbsoluteResidue, AreRelativelyPrime, DiscreteLog,
  CRT (ChineseRemainder), IsPrimitiveMod, ConvertToBase, ConvertFromBase,

  MakeSet, Union, Intersection, IndexCalculus, IndexCalculusPrecalculation,
  FindPrimitiveElementMod, FindRandomPrimitiveElementMod and Compose
* Fixed IsStrongPseudoprime
* Fixed the integer power functions and use MPFR for the float one if
  available.
* Document some functions
* elements, rows, columns accept null and treat it like 0x0 matrix
* SYNTAX: Allow return after comma to break a long vector input
* Mod matrices after all primitives (fixes for example "-[1] mod 2")
* when function is undocumented, print at least a prototype on help
* SYNTAX: 'mod' and 'call' now binds tighter then logical operators to
  make "if a == b mod n and a == c mod n then ..."

Changes to 0.5.3

Note the syntax changes marked with 'SYNTAX:'

* Very basic line graphing of R->R functions with LinePlot function
* Use MPFR for some floating point functions such as powers, logs, sin/cos
  and such.  This increases the speed of those operations by about 10 fold
  or more.  I will start migrating towards MPFR only support in the future.
  See www.mpfr.org.
* "a^b mod m" is now done sanely and fast just like the PowerMod function
* Rudimentary MathML output support
* Add Copy Answer As Plain/LaTeX/MathML/Troff menu items
* SYNTAX: A null inside a matrix expansion is treated as an empty matrix.  So
  [null,1,2] will be expanded as [1,2]
* SYNTAX: Allow rationals and integers as complex numbers though this support is
  kind of experimental
* Increase some limits on factorizations
* SYNTAX: Add (<expr>)i operator macro which will multiply <expr> by i
* SYNTAX: Negation parsing changed -1^k still parses as (-1)^k but -a^k parses
  as -(a^k) (where a is anything but a number
* Rational powers now return integers if possible, and so the
  SymbolicSquareRoot and SymbolicNthRoot functions are not necessary
* Nicer printing of complex numbers
* Printing fixes
* Fractions printed nicely in troff and latex mode
* Fix crash on setting built in parameters if there is an exception
* Add MaximalPrimePowerFactors, PrimeFactors and CombineFactorizations,
  RemoveFactor, Gravity (the gravitational constant), EulerConstant,
  FermatFactorization, IsGaussInteger, IsPositiveInteger, MillerRabinTest
* Use MillerRabinTest in IsPrime adding a config parameter for this
* Remove SymbolicSquareRoot, SymbolicNthRoot (sqrt and rational powers
  is the same thing)
* Add some new aliases for a few functions
* Better EulerPhi implementation
* Fix Factors
* SYNTAX: Fix precedence of : to be lower then that of standard arithmetic
  operators
* SYNTAX: Factorial now binds more closely then power
* SYNTAX: Allow more matlab like notation of getting whole rows/columns
  (such as foo@(2,:))
* Add an Edit menu with Copy and Paste
* Add "Really want to quit" dialog and allow quitting while calculations are
  running
* Allow reading arbitrarily long compiled file record lines
* Some very minor leaks fixed
* Fix interrupting input while not calculating anything (this was a nasty
  bug that prevented any further thing to be evaluated)
* Don't allow executing anything if something else is executing, thus causing
  a crash.
* A number of minor bugs squashed
* And finally a new small easter egg

Changes to 0.5.2

* UP TO DATE ONLINE MANUAL: well, don't be too excited, it's just a text
  file, but can now be viewed directly from genius.
* Use vte instead of zvt since zvt was giving me fits (vte is on the other
  hand giving me different fits).
* Fix precedence of defining a function (now "function f(x) = foo mod bar"
  will work as expected)
* Using rationals in modular mode will take the inverses mod n
* Negative powers and division of matrices in modular mode
* Implement IsPrimeProbability, LucasNumber, ModInvert, EulerPhi,
  Subfactorial, GoldenRatio
* Use gmp for NextPrime
* Kill some unimplemented functions so that people don't get confused
* Some function renaming (where old syntax was used) and some more help
  strings
* The help output is now nicer
* In latex output mode we print [] instead of () for matrices since
  I think it's nicer
* The readline helper is now in the libexec directory as it should be
* Fixup the plugin API a bit and hide the test plugin from the GUI
* The .desktop is now updated, using intltool and installed in proper new
  location and all that good stuff
* Fixed the gettext/intltool stuff, now actually installs translations
  correctly and all that
* Random minor fixes and cleanup

Changes to 0.5.1

* Fix rounding when first digit is rounded and is 9 (reported by
  Kai Arstila)
* Fix atan by using implementation from Guillermo Ballester Valor

Changes to 0.4.4

* bugfixes, bugfixes, bugfixes
* very very very initial shlib plugin support

Changes to 0.4.3

* deprecated the bc way of adding functions
* better interactive parsing
* i18n actually works

Changes to 0.4.[12]

* new gnome frontend

Changes to 0.4 (includes all changes from all >0.3.1)

* new syntax for writing functions, more math like
* functions are now passed by value not by reference, this is unfortunately
  backwards incompatible but adds consistency and flexibility, so just instead
  of sum(4,5,&func) you'd write sum(4,5,func), with anonymous functions,
  the calling syntax does not change. inside the function then, one would use
  func(...) instead of *func(...)
* library file is compiled now for quick startup
* many new functions
* more matrix support
